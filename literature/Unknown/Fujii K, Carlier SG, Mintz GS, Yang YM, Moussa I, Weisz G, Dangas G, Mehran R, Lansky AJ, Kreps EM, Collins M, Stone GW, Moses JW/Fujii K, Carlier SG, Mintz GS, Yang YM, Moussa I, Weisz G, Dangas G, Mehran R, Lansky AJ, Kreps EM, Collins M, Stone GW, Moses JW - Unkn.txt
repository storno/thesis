Numerous mutant G protein-coupled receptors with diminished or no function have
been described that are naturally occurring or that are the product of gene
manipulation. It has largely been assumed that receptor mutants do not affect the
function of the wild-type receptor; however, the occurrence of G protein-coupled 
receptor dimerization suggests the possibility that an intermolecular interaction
between mutant and wild-type receptors can occur. We have shown previously that
the D2 dopamine receptor (D2DR) exists as dimers in cell lines and brain tissue. 
In this study, we demonstrated that mutant D2DR can modulate the function of the 
wild-type D2DR. While attempting to elucidate the structure of the D2DR dimer, we
demonstrated that nonfunctional D2DR substitution and truncation mutants
antagonized wild-type D2DR function. Furthermore, from analyses of this
interaction between the receptor mutants and the D2DR, using photoaffinity
labeling, we provide evidence that the D2DR is oligomeric in the cell.
