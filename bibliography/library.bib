abstract = {LGR5+ stem cells reside at crypt bottoms, intermingled with Paneth cells that provide Wnt, Notch and epidermal growth factor signals. Here we find that the related RNF43 and ZNRF3 transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligases are uniquely expressed in LGR5+ stem cells. Simultaneous deletion of the two genes encoding these proteins in the intestinal epithelium of mice induces rapidly growing adenomas containing high numbers of Paneth and LGR5+ stem cells. In vitro, growth of organoids derived from these adenomas is arrested when Wnt secretion is inhibited, indicating a dependence of the adenoma stem cells on Wnt produced by adenoma Paneth cells. In the HEK293T human cancer cell line, expression of RNF43 blocks Wnt responses and targets surface-expressed frizzled receptors to lysosomes. In the RNF43-mutant colorectal cancer cell line HCT116, reconstitution of RNF43 expression removes its response to exogenous Wnt. We conclude that RNF43 and ZNRF3 reduce Wnt signals by selectively ubiquitinating frizzled receptors, thereby targeting these Wnt receptors for degradation.},

abstract = {Genetic information flows from DNA to macromolecular structures-the dominant force in the molecular organization of life. However, recent work suggests that metabolite availability to the hexosamine and Golgi N-glycosylation pathways exerts control over the assembly of macromolecular complexes on the cell surface and, in this capacity, acts upstream of signaling and gene expression. The structure and number of N-glycans per protein molecule cooperate to regulate lectin binding and thereby the distribution of glycoproteins at the cell surface. Congenital disorders of glycosylation provide insight as extreme hypomorphisms, whereas milder deficiencies may encompass many common chronic conditions, including autoimmunity, metabolic syndrome, and aging.},

abstract = {Site-directed mutagenesis guided by evolutionary trace analysis revealed that substitution of V179 and W183 within a cluster of evolutionarily important residues on the surface of the fourth transmembrane domain of the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (beta(1)AR) significantly reduced the propensity of the receptor to self-assemble into homodimers as assessed by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer in living cells. These results suggest that mutation of V179 and W183 result in conformational changes that reduce homodimerization either directly by interfering with the dimerization interface or indirectly by causing local misfolding that result in reduced self-assembly. However, the mutations did not cause a general misfolding of the beta(1)AR as they did not prevent heterodimerization with the beta(2)AR. The homodimerization-compromised mutants were significantly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and could not be properly matured and trafficked to the cell surface. Lipophilic beta-adrenergic ligands acted as pharmacological chaperones by restoring both dimerization and plasma membrane trafficking of the ER-retained dimerization-compromised beta(1)AR mutants. These results clearly indicate that homodimerization occurs early in the biosynthetic process in the ER and that pharmacological chaperones can promote both dimerization and cell surface targeting, most likely by stabilizing receptor conformations compatible with the two processes.},

abstract = {The serotonin(1A) receptor is a representative member of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily and serves as an important target in the development of therapeutic agents for neuropsychiatric disorders. Oligomerization of GPCRs is an important contemporary issue since it is believed to be a crucial determinant for cellular signaling. In this work, we monitored the oligomerization status of the serotonin(1A) receptor tagged to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (5-HT(1A)R-EYFP) in live cells utilizing time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy decay. We interpret the unresolved fast component of the observed anisotropy decay as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between 5-HT(1A)R-EYFP molecules (homo-FRET). Homo-FRET enjoys certain advantages over hetero-FRET in the analysis of receptor oligomerization. Our results reveal the presence of constitutive oligomers of the serotonin(1A) receptor in live cells. We further show that the oligomerization status of the receptor is independent of ligand stimulation and sphingolipid depletion. Interestingly, acute (but not chronic) cholesterol depletion appears to enhance the oligomerization process. Importantly, our results are independent of receptor expression level, thereby ruling out complications arising due to high expression. These results have potential implications in future therapeutic strategies in pathophysiological conditions in which serotonin(1A) receptors are implicated.},

@article{Fung2009,
abstract = {The beta(2)-adrenoceptor (beta(2)AR) was one of the first Family A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) shown to form oligomers in cellular membranes, yet we still know little about the number and arrangement of protomers in oligomers, the influence of ligands on the organization or stability of oligomers, or the requirement for other proteins to promote oligomerization. We used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to characterize the oligomerization of purified beta(2)AR site-specifically labelled at three different positions with fluorophores and reconstituted into a model lipid bilayer. Our results suggest that the beta(2)AR is predominantly tetrameric following reconstitution into phospholipid vesicles. Agonists and antagonists have little effect on the relative orientation of protomers in oligomeric complexes. In contrast, binding of inverse agonists leads to significant increases in FRET efficiencies for most labelling pairs, suggesting that this class of ligand promotes tighter packing of protomers and/or the formation of more complex oligomers by reducing conformational fluctuations in individual protomers. The results provide new structural insights into beta(2)AR oligomerization and suggest a possible mechanism for the functional effects of inverse agonists.},

To demonstrate their presence in native tissues, we developed a time-resolved FRET strategy that is based on receptor labeling with selective fluorescent ligands. Specific FRET signals were observed with four different receptors expressed in cell lines, consistent with their dimeric or oligomeric nature in these transfected cells. More notably, the comparison between FRET signals measured with sets of fluorescent agonists and antagonists was consistent with an asymmetric relationship of the two protomers in an activated GPCR dimer. Finally, we applied the strategy to native tissues and succeeded in demonstrating the presence of oxytocin receptor dimers and/or oligomers in mammary gland.},

The SNAP-tag is derived from the human DNA repair protein O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) and can be covalently labeled in living cells using O6-benzylguanine derivatives bearing a chemical probe. Here we report the generation of an AGT-based tag, named CLIP-tag, which reacts specifically with O2-benzylcytosine derivatives. Because SNAP-tag and CLIP-tag possess orthogonal substrate specificities, SNAP and CLIP fusion proteins can be labeled simultaneously and specifically with different molecular probes in living cells. We furthermore show simultaneous pulse-chase experiments to visualize different generations of two different proteins in one sample.},

@article{Ikeda2012,
abstract = {Background and purpose. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) and $\beta$-adrenoceptors in the airways and lungs are clinically important in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. However, the quantitative and qualitative estimation of these receptors by radioligand binding approaches in human airways has not yet been reported because of tissue limitations. Experimental approach. The regional distribution and relative proportion of mAChR and $\beta$-adrenoceptor subtypes were evaluated in human bronchus and lung parenchyma by a tissue segment binding method with [(3) H]-N-methylscopolamine ([(3) H]-NMS) for mAChRs and with [(3) H]-CGP-12,177 for $\beta$-adrenoceptors. Functional responses to carbachol and isoproterenol were also analyzed in the bronchus. Key Results. M(3) subtype predominantly occurred in the bronchus, but the density decreased from the segmental to subsegmental bronchus, and was abolished in lung parenchyma. On the other hand, the M(1) subtype occurred in the lung only, and the M(2) subtype was distributed ubiquitously in the bronchus and lungs. $\beta$(2) -adrenoceptors were increased along the airways, and their densities in the subsegmental bronchus and lung parenchyma were approximately two-fold higher than those of mAChRs in the same region. $\beta$(1) -adrenoceptors also existed in lung parenchyma but were undetectable in the bronchus. The muscarinic contractions and adrenergic relaxations in both bronchial regions were mediated through M(3) -mAChRs and $\beta$(2) -adrenoceptors, respectively. Conclusions and Implications. From the present radioligand binding approach with intact tissue segments, we constructed a distribution map of mAChRs and $\beta$-adrenoceptors in human bronchus and lung parenchyma for the first time, providing important evidence for future pharmacotherapy and new drug development for respiratory disorders. © 2012 The Authors.

Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we found that the $\beta$(2)-adrenergic receptor ($\beta$(2)AR) responded to repeated activation with altered activation kinetics. Polymorphic variants of the $\beta$(2)AR displayed divergent changes of $\beta$(2)AR activation kinetics that closely mimicked their different efficacies to generate cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. More efficacious variants became faster in their activation kinetics, whereas less efficacious variants became slower, compared to their initial activation. These differences depended on phosphorylation of the receptor by G protein-coupled receptor kinases. Our findings suggest an intrinsic, polymorphism-specific property of the $\beta$(2)AR that alters activation kinetics upon continued stimulation and that may account for individual drug responses.},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) self-associate as dimers or higher-order oligomers in living cells. The stability of associated GPCRs has not been extensively studied, but it is generally thought that these receptors move between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments as intact dimers or oligomers. Here we show that $\beta$(2)-adrenergic receptors ($\beta$(2)ARs) that self-associate at the plasma membrane can dissociate during agonist-induced internalization. We use bioluminescence-resonance energy transfer (BRET) to monitor movement of $\beta$(2)ARs between subcellular compartments. BRET between $\beta$(2)ARs and plasma membrane markers decreases in response to agonist activation, while at the same time BRET between $\beta$(2)ARs and endosome markers increases. Energy transfer between $\beta$(2)ARs is decreased in a similar manner if either the donor- or acceptor-labeled receptor is mutated to impair agonist binding and internalization. These changes take place over the course of 30 minutes, persist after agonist is removed, and are sensitive to several inhibitors of arrestin- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The magnitude of the decrease in BRET between donor- and acceptor-labeled $\beta$(2)ARs suggests that at least half of the receptors that contribute to the BRET signal are physically segregated by internalization. These results are consistent with the possibility that $\beta$(2)ARs associate transiently with each other in the plasma membrane, or that $\beta$(2)AR dimers or oligomers are actively disrupted during internalization.},

abstract = {Olfactory receptors (ORs) comprise more than half of the large class I G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. Although cloned over a decade ago, little is known about their properties because wild-type ORs do not efficiently reach the cell surface following heterologous expression. Receptor-receptor interactions strongly influence surface trafficking of other GPCRs, and we examined whether a similar mechanism might be involved in OR surface expression. Olfactory neurons are known to express beta-adrenergic receptors (ARs), and we found that coexpression with beta(2)-ARs, but not any other AR subtypes, dramatically increased mouse 71 (M71) OR surface expression in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. A persistent physical interaction between M71 ORs and beta(2)-ARs was shown by coimmunoprecipitation and by cointernalization of the two receptors in response to their specific ligands. Also, coexpression of wild-type M71 ORs with beta(2)-ARs resulted in cAMP responses to the M71 ligand acetophenone. Finally, in situ hybridization studies showed extensive colocalization of M71 OR and beta(2)-AR expression in mouse olfactory epithelium. These data demonstrate the successful heterologous surface expression of a functional wild-type OR and reveal that persistent physical association with other GPCRs can control OR surface expression.},

abstract = {Oligomerization of the G protein-coupled cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor has been demonstrated, but its molecular basis and functional importance are not clear. We now examine contributions of transmembrane (TM) segments to oligomerization of this receptor using a peptide competitive inhibition strategy. Oligomerization of CCK receptors tagged at the carboxyl terminus with Renilla luciferase or yellow fluorescent protein was quantified using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). Synthetic peptides representing TM I, II, V, VI, and VII of the CCK receptor were utilized as competitors. Of these, only TM VI and VII peptides disrupted receptor BRET. Control studies established that the beta2-adrenergic receptor TM VI peptide that disrupts oligomerization of that receptor had no effect on CCK receptor BRET. Notably, disruption of CCK receptor oligomerization had no effect on agonist binding, biological activity, or receptor internalization. To gain insight into the face of TM VI contributing to oligomerization, we utilized analogous peptides with alanines in positions 315, 319, and 323 (interhelical face) or 317, 321, and 325 (external lipid-exposed face). The Ala317,321,325 peptide eliminated the disruptive effect on CCK receptor BRET, whereas the other mutant peptide behaved like wild-type TM VI. This suggests that the lipid-exposed face of the CCK receptor TM VI most contributes to oligomerization and supports external contact dimerization of helical bundles, rather than domain-swapped dimerization. Fluorescent CCK receptor mutants with residues 317, 321, and 325 replaced with alanines were also prepared and failed to yield significant resonance transfer signals using either BRET or a morphological FRET assay, further supporting this interpretation.},

abstract = {Heptahelical receptors that interact with heterotrimeric G proteins represent the largest family of proteins involved in signal transduction across biological membranes. Although these receptors generally were believed to be monomeric entities, a growing body of evidence suggests that they may form functionally relevant dimers. However, a definitive demonstration of the existence of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) dimers at the surface of living cells is still lacking. Here, using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), as a protein-protein interaction assay in whole cells, we unambiguously demonstrate that the human beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR) forms constitutive homodimers when expressed in HEK-293 cells. Receptor stimulation with the hydrophilic agonist isoproterenol led to an increase in the transfer of energy between beta(2)AR molecules genetically fused to the BRET donor (Renilla luciferase) and acceptor (green fluorescent protein), respectively, indicating that the agonist interacts with receptor dimers at the cell surface. Inhibition of receptor internalization did not prevent agonist-promoted BRET, demonstrating that it did not result from clustering of receptors within endosomes. The notion that receptor dimers exist at the cell surface was confirmed further by the observation that BS3, a cell-impermeable cross-linking agent, increased BRET between beta(2)AR molecules. The selectivity of the constitutive interaction was documented by demonstrating that no BRET occurred between the beta(2)AR and two other unrelated GPCR. In contrast, the well characterized agonist-dependent interaction between the beta(2)AR and the regulatory protein beta-arrestin could be monitored by BRET. Taken together, the data demonstrate that GPCR exist as functional dimers in vivo and that BRET-based assays can be used to study both constitutive and hormone-promoted selective protein-protein interactions.},

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) were long thought to be an exception, but in recent years a lot of evidence has accumulated that GPCRs also can form dimers, even though it is far from certain when and where they actually do so under physiological conditions. Dimerization of GPCRs does not generally seem to be required for ligand recognition or signaling. However, dimerization may serve to affect receptor mobility at the cell surface and in intracellular trafficking, and may be involved in and affect their signaling functions.},

The results of [3H]formoterol saturation binding and formoterol inhibition of [3H]formoterol binding were consistent with binding to a single class of receptors (Kd = 1.34 +/- 0.15 nM, Bmax = 154.9 +/- 8.0 fmol/mg protein in guinea pig lung membranes, n = 8; Kd = 1.05 +/- 0.17 nM, Bmax = 67.8 +/- 8.1 fmol/mg protein in human lung membranes, n = 5) and competition assays with other agonists and antagonists disclosed only a single class of site. The nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue GTP gamma S caused a reduction in both Kd and Bmax, indicating that the receptors labelled by [3H]formoterol are coupled to a guanine nucleotide binding regulatory protein. Receptor mapping of [3H]formoterol binding sites shows that beta 2-adrenoceptors were widely distributed in both guinea pig and human lung, with dense labelling over airway epithelium and uniformly over alveolar walls, and sparse labelling of airway and vascular smooth muscle. In addition, submucosal glands were also sparsely labelled in human bronchus. The distribution of beta 2-adrenoceptors was similar to the pattern previously described with non-selective radiolabelled antagonists in the presence of selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonists.},

abstract = {Although homodimerization has been demonstrated for a large number of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), no general role has been attributed to this process. Because it is known that oligomerization plays a key role in the quality control and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) export of many proteins, we sought to determine if homodimerization could play such a role in GPCR biogenesis. Using the beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) as a model, cell fractionation studies revealed that receptor homodimerization is an event occurring as early as the ER. Supporting the hypothesis that receptor homodimerization is involved in ER processing, beta2AR mutants lacking an ER-export motif or harboring a heterologous ER-retention signal dimerized with the wild-type receptor and inhibited its trafficking to the cell surface. Finally, in addition to inhibiting receptor dimerization, disruption of the putative dimerization motif, 276GXXXGXXXL284, prevented normal trafficking of the receptor to the plasma membrane. Taken together, these data indicate that beta2AR homodimerization plays an important role in ER export and cell surface targeting.},

These experiments yield excellent quantitative data, but have low temporal and spatial resolution. In addition, the use of radioligands presents safety concerns. Here we provide a general procedure for an alternative approach with high temporal and spatial resolution, based on Tb(+)-labeled fluorescent receptor ligands and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET). This protocol and its design are detailed here for the parathyroid hormone receptor, a class B GPCR, and its fluorescently labeled 34-amino acid peptide ligand, but it can be easily modified for other receptors and their appropriately labeled ligands. We discuss three protocol options that use Tb(+)-labeled fluorescent ligands: a time-resolved fluorescence separation option that works on native receptors but requires separation of bound and unbound ligand; a TR-FRET option using SNAP-tag-labeled receptors for high-throughput screening; and a TR-FRET option that uses fluorescently labeled antibodies directed against an epitope engineered into the Flag-labeled receptors' N terminus. These protocol options can be used as standard procedures with very high signal-to-background ratios in order to characterize ligands and their receptors in living cells and in cell membranes via straightforward plate-reader measurements.},

The discovery of cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) represents a major breakthrough for the transport of large-cargo molecules that may be useful in clinical applications. CPPs are rich in basic amino acids such as arginine and lysine and are able to translocate over membranes and gain access to the cell interior. They can deliver large-cargo molecules, such as oligonucleotides, into cells. Endocytosis and direct penetration have been suggested as the two major uptake mechanisms, a subject still under debate. Unresolved questions include the detailed molecular uptake mechanism(s), reasons for cell toxicity, and the delivery efficiency of CPPs for different cargoes. Here, we give a review focused on uptake mechanisms used by CPPs for membrane translocation and certain experimental factors that affect the mechanism(s).},

abstract = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can form heteromeric complexes. Herein, we describe a new approach to test the heteromerization of 2 receptors, or 2 receptor subunits, and to study the stoichiometry of the resulting complexes. As a proof-of-concept study, we investigated whether metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), in addition to being well-known homodimers, can form heteromers. To that aim, we combine the benefits of time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (trFRET) with the specific, cell-surface labeling of SNAP- and CLIP-tagged rat mGluR subunits, expressed in a mammalian cell line. First, we show that mGlu2 and mGlu4 subunits (but not mGlu2 and mGlu1) can heteromerize. Moreover, our trFRET data are consistent with mGluR subunits forming strict homodimeric receptors on single expression, and a combination of strict heterodimeric and strict homodimeric receptors on coexpression. Second, a comprehensive analysis reveals that from the 21 possible pairs of 2 mGluR subunits out of 7 subtypes (mGlu1 to 8, but not 6), only 11 are able to form heterodimers. These findings were further validated by biochemical and functional complementation studies. In addition to describing a new method to analyze cell-surface receptor complexes, our data reveal a new level of complexity within the mGluR family.},

We report the crystal structure of a human beta2-adrenergic receptor-T4 lysozyme fusion protein bound to the partial inverse agonist carazolol at 2.4 angstrom resolution. The structure provides a high-resolution view of a human G protein-coupled receptor bound to a diffusible ligand. Ligand-binding site accessibility is enabled by the second extracellular loop, which is held out of the binding cavity by a pair of closely spaced disulfide bridges and a short helical segment within the loop. Cholesterol, a necessary component for crystallization, mediates an intriguing parallel association of receptor molecules in the crystal lattice. Although the location of carazolol in the beta2-adrenergic receptor is very similar to that of retinal in rhodopsin, structural differences in the ligand-binding site and other regions highlight the challenges in using rhodopsin as a template model for this large receptor family.},

abstract = {HTRF (Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence) is the most frequently used generic assay technology to measure analytes in a homogenous format, which is the ideal platform used for drug target studies in high-throughput screening (HTS). This technology combines fluorescence resonance energy transfer technology (FRET) with time-resolved measurement (TR). In TR-FRET assays, a signal is generated through fluorescent resonance energy transfer between a donor and an acceptor molecule when in close proximity to each other. Buffer and media interference is dramatically reduced by dual-wavelength detection, and the final signal is proportional to the extent of product formation. The HTRF assay is usually sensitive and robust that can be miniaturized into the 384 and 1536-well plate formats. This assay technology has been applied to many antibody-based assays including GPCR signaling (cAMP and IP-One), kinases, cytokines and biomarkers, bioprocess (antibody and protein production), as well as the assays for protein-protein, proteinpeptide, and protein-DNA/RNA interactions.Since its introduction to the drug-screening world over ten years ago, researchers have used HTRF to expedite the study of GPCRs, kinases, new biomarkers, protein-protein interactions, and other targets of interest. HTRF has also been utilized as an alternative method for bioprocess monitoring. The first-generation HTRF technology, which uses Europium cryptate as a fluorescence donor to monitor reactions between biomolecules, was extended in 2008 through the introduction of a second-generation donor, Terbium cryptate (Tb), enhancing screening performance. Terbium cryptate possesses different photophysical properties compared to Europium, including increased quantum yield and a higher molar extinction coefficient. In addition to being compatible with the same acceptor fluorophors used with Europium, it can serve as a donor fluorophore to green-emitting fluors because it has multiple emission peaks including one at 490 nm. Moreover, all Terbium HTRF assays can be read on the same HTRF-compatible instruments as Europium HTRF assays.Overall, HTRF is a highly sensitive, robust technology for the detection of molecular interactions in vitro and is widely used for primary and secondary screening phases of drug development. This review addresses the general principles of HTRF and its current applications in drug discovery.},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors are one of the most actively studied families of proteins. However, despite the ubiquity of protein dimerization and oligomerization as a structural and functional motif in biology, until the last decade they were generally considered as monomeric, non-interacting polypeptides. For the metabotropic glutamate-like group of G protein-coupled receptors, it is now firmly established that they exist and function as dimers or, potentially, even within higher-order structures. Despite some evidence continuing to support the view that rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptors are predominantly monomers, many recent studies are consistent with the dimerization/oligomerization of such receptors. Key roles suggested for dimerization of G protein-coupled receptors include control of protein maturation and cell surface delivery and providing the correct framework for interactions with both hetero-trimeric G proteins and arrestins to allow signal generation and its termination. As G protein-coupled receptors are the most targeted group of proteins for the development of therapeutic small molecule medicines, recent indications that hetero-dimerization between co-expressed G protein-coupled receptors may be a common process offers the potential for the development of more selective and tissue restricted medicines. However, many of the key experiments have, so far, been limited to model cell systems. Priorities for the future include the generation of tools and reagents able to identify unequivocally potential G protein-coupled receptor hetero-dimers in native tissues and detailed analyses of the influence of hetero-dimerization on receptor function and pharmacology.},

abstract = {A theoretical model is proposed for the apparent efficiency of fluorescence (F\"{o}rster) resonance energy transfer (FRET) in mixtures of free monomers and homo-oligomeric protein complexes of uniform size. The model takes into account possible pathways for transfer of optical excitations from single donors to multiple acceptors and from multiple donors (non-simultaneously) to single acceptors. This necessary departure from the standard theory has been suggested in the literature, but it has only been successfully implemented for a few particular cases, such as for particular geometries of the oligomers. The predictions of the present theoretical model differ significantly from those of the standard theory, with the exception of the case of dimers, for which agreement is observed. This model therefore provides new insights into the FRET behavior of oligomers comprising more than two monomers, and also suggests means for determining the size of oligomeric protein complexes as well as the proportion of associated and unassociated monomers.},

abstract = {Given the mounting evidence for involvement of delta opioid receptors in the tolerance and physical dependence of mu opioid receptor agonists, we have investigated the possible physical interaction between mu and delta opioid receptors by using bivalent ligands. Based on reports of suppression of antinociceptive tolerance by the delta antagonist naltrindole (NTI), bivalent ligands [mu-delta agonist-antagonist (MDAN) series] that contain different length spacers, and pharmacophores derived from NTI and the mu agonist oxymorphone, have been synthesized and evaluated by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration in the tail-flick test in mice. In acute i.c.v. studies, the bivalent ligands functioned as agonists with potencies ranging from 1.6- to 45-fold greater than morphine. In contrast, the monovalent mu agonist analogues were substantially more potent than the MDAN congeners and were essentially equipotent with one another and oxymorphone. Pretreatment with NTI decreased the ED(50) values for MDAN-19 to a greater degree than for MDAN-16 but had no effect on MDAN-21. Chronic i.c.v. studies revealed that MDAN ligands whose spacer was 16 atoms or longer produced less dependence than either morphine or mu monovalent control MA-19. On the other hand, both physical dependence and tolerance were suppressed at MDAN spacer lengths of 19 atoms or greater. These data suggest that physical interaction between the mu and delta opioid receptors modulates mu-mediated tolerance and dependence. Because MDAN-21 was found to be 50-fold more potent than morphine by the i.v. route (i.v.), it offers a previously uncharacterized approach for the development of analgesics devoid of tolerance and dependence.},

Elucidation and manipulation of such protein complexes offers new therapeutic possibilities. We describe a methodology combining time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) with snap-tag technology to quantitatively analyze protein-protein interactions at the surface of living cells, in a high throughput-compatible format. Using this approach, we examined whether G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are monomers or assemble into dimers or larger oligomers--a matter of intense debate. We obtained evidence for the oligomeric state of both class A and class C GPCRs. We also observed different quaternary structure of GPCRs for the neurotransmitters glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA): whereas metabotropic glutamate receptors assembled into strict dimers, the GABA(B) receptors spontaneously formed dimers of heterodimers, offering a way to modulate G-protein coupling efficacy. This approach will be useful in systematic analysis of cell-surface protein interaction in living cells.},

abstract = {The binding of the beta-adrenoceptor radioligand [125I]-iodocyanopindolol (I-CYP) has been studied in pig lung parenchyma and the distribution of binding sites visualised by light microscopic autoradiography. I-CYP binding was saturable (maximum binding capacity Bmax = 51 +/- 3 fmol mg-1 protein), involving sites with high affinity (dissociation constant KD = 73 +/- 10 pM). Specific I-CYP binding was displaceable both by beta-adrenoceptor agonists ((-)-isoprenaline greater than (-)-adrenaline greater than (+/-)-fenoterol greater than (-)-noradrenaline greater than (+)-isoprenaline greater than (+/-)-RO363) and antagonists ((+/-)-propranolol greater than ICI-118551 greater than atenolol), indicating a predominance of beta 2-adrenoceptors. Further analysis showed that displacement data for the beta 1-selective antagonist atenolol and the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI-118551 were fitted best to a 2 binding site model and that both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors were present in pig lung in the ratio 28:72 respectively. Autoradiographic grains were localized over tissue and were most dense over alveolar walls greater than vascular endothelium greater than vascular smooth muscle greater than bronchial smooth muscle = bronchial epithelium. Atenolol (10(-5) M) caused a 31\% reduction in specific grain density over alveolar wall tissue, while a 10 fold lower concentration of ICI-118551 (10(-6) M) caused a 50\% decrease. These results are consistent with binding data in pig lung parenchyma demonstrating a mixed population of beta-adrenoceptors with a predominance of the beta 2 subtype. 6 It is possible that the previously described relaxant responses of the pig lung parenchyma strip to beta-agonists, mediated via beta 2-adrenoceptors, resulted from the sum of reactivities in airway and vascular smooth muscle together with relaxation of alveolar interstitial cells.},

Analysis of adrenergic receptor ligand-binding mutants within the context of the reported high-resolution structure of beta2AR-T4L provides insights into inverse-agonist binding and the structural changes required to accommodate catecholamine agonists. Amino acids known to regulate receptor function are linked through packing interactions and a network of hydrogen bonds, suggesting a conformational pathway from the ligand-binding pocket to regions that interact with G proteins.},

Although GPCRs were thought to function as monomers, many studies support the hypothesis that G protein coupling involves the formation of GPCR homo- and/or hetero-complexes. These complex systems have been suggested to exhibit specific signaling cascades, pharmacological, internalization, and recycling properties.

abstract = {Most of the drugs that are currently used to treat airway diseases interact with receptors expressed by cells in the airways. This makes inhaled delivery efficient because it reaches the key target cells and has a low risk of systemic side effects. Both beta(2)-agonists and anticholinergics target autonomic receptors on airway smooth muscle of large and small airways. Inhaled beta(2)-agonists also interact with beta(2)-receptors expressed on other important target cells, including mast cells and postcapillary venules. Anticholinergic bronchodilators target M(3) muscarinic receptors on airway smooth muscle, which in small airways may be activated by extraneuronal acetylcholine. Corticosteroids target glucocorticoid receptors (GR), which are widely distributed so that they are best given by inhalation to interact with intracellular GR in the respiratory tract and to avoid side effects from activation of GR in extrapulmonary tissues such as bone. By contrast, cysteinyl-leukotriene 1 receptors are mainly expresses in airway smooth muscle so that antileukotrienes are less effective clinically than beta(2)-agonists and corticosteroids, but oral delivery is possible as there are minimal side effects. There are many other receptor targets in lung and for several of these receptors, such as receptors for chemotactic agonists, selective antagonists are in clinical development. For drugs that inhibit chemotactic receptors, systemic delivery is more appropriate to prevent the inflammatory cells that bear these receptors from being recruited into the airways by locally released chemotactic factors. Many novel receptors, including orphan receptors, have now been identified as these may be future targets for developing novel therapies for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.},

abstract = {The adrenergic receptors are among the best characterized G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and knowledge on this receptor family has provided several important paradigms about GPCR function and regulation. One of the most recent paradigms initially supported by studies on adrenergic receptors is that both $\beta$arrestins and G proteincoupled receptors themselves can act as scaffolds binding a variety of proteins and this can result in growing complexity of the receptor-mediated cellular effects. In this review we will briefly summarize the main features of $\beta$arrestin binding to the adrenergic receptor subtypes and we will review more in detail the main proteins found to selectively interact with distinct AR subtype. At the end, we will review the main findings on oligomerization of the AR subtypes.},

abstract = {Adrenergic drugs acting through the beta(2)-adrenoceptor (beta(2)-AR) adenylate cyclase (AC) signal transduction system elicit a variety of responses within the mammalian airway epithelium; however, its composition of multiple phenotypically differentiated cell types complicates the understanding of the regulation cascades within this tissue. The present study evaluates beta(2)-AR mRNA level, number, subtype and the cyclic adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) response to isoproterenol (iso) in the human airway epithelial cell lines 16HBE14o(-), Calu-3 and A549, using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), radioligand binding studies, [(3)H]-radioimmunoassay and immunocytochemical staining. After 4-5 days in culture, all three cell types produced beta(2)-AR mRNA and protein at a magnitude of gene expression levels Calu-3>or=16HBE14o(-)>A549, whereas control cells Cos-1 and Caco-2 were negative. The beta(2)-AR adenylate cyclase system was highly expressed and functional in the human airway epithelial cells Calu-3 and 16HBE14o(-). The mean beta(2)-AR density (B(max)), equilibrium dissociation constant (K(D)), and the percentage of beta-AR subtypes assessed by radioligand binding were approximately 9908+/-1127 and 6423+/-895 binding sites/cell, 32+/-2.7 pM and 25+/-1.1 pM, and approximately 100\% in Calu-3 and 16HBE14o(-)cells, respectively. However, in the alveolar cell type A549 the cell surface beta(2)-AR was virtually undetectable by (-)-[(125)I]-iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) binding. Stimulation of cultured cells with (-)-isoproterenol enhanced the basal cyclic AMP accumulation only in Calu-3 and 16HBE14o(-) cells, which was blocked by the beta(2)-selective antagonist ICI 118,551, but not by the beta(1)-selective antagonist CGP 20712A, confirming functional coupling of the beta(2)-AR to adenylate cyclase in these cells. Immunocytochemical staining localised the receptor on the cell membrane and the cytoplasm in Calu-3 and 16HBE14o(-) cells, while it was confined to the cytoplasm only in A549 cells. In conclusion, the beta(2)-AR expression and its functional coupling to adenylyl cyclase was very high in the human airway epithelial cells Calu-3 and 16HBE14o(-), but not in A549, suggesting that the cell lines Calu-3 and 16HBE14o(-) present suitable models to study function and regulation of the beta-adrenoceptor signalling in the respiratory system.},

abstract = {The C terminus of the beta(2)-adrenoceptor (AR) interacts with G protein-coupled receptor kinases and arrestins in an agonist-dependent manner, suggesting that conformational changes induced by ligands in the transmembrane domains are transmitted to the C terminus. We used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to examine ligand-induced structural changes in the distance between two positions on the beta(2)-AR C terminus and cysteine 265 (Cys-265) at the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane domain 6. The donor fluorophore FlAsH (Fluorescein Arsenical Helix binder) was attached to a CCPGCC motif introduced at position 351-356 in the proximal C terminus or at the distal C terminus. An acceptor fluorophore, Alexa Fluor 568, was attached to Cys-265. FRET analyses revealed that the average distances between Cys-265 and the proximal and distal FlAsH sites were 57 and 62A(,) respectively. These relatively large distances suggest that the C terminus is in an extended, relatively unstructured conformation. Nevertheless, we observed ligand-specific changes in FRET. All ligands induced an increase in FRET between the proximal C-terminal FlAsH site and Cys-265. Ligands that have been shown to induce arrestin-dependent ERK activation, including the catecholamine agonists and the inverse agonist ICI118551, led to a decrease in FRET between the distal FlAsH site and Cys-265, whereas other ligands had no effect or induced a small increase in FRET. Taken together the results provide new insight into the structure of the C terminus of the beta(2)-AR as well as ligand-induced conformational changes that may be relevant to arrestin-dependent regulation and signaling.},

abstract = {Rat serosal mast cell beta-adrenergic receptors were characterized both functionally by assessing changes in histamine release and cyclic 3',5' adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and directly by radioligand binding studies using [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA), a beta-adrenergic antagonist. Mast cells were obtained by lavage of the pleural and peritoneal cavities of Sprague-Dawley rats and were purified on metrizamide gradients to greater than 95\% purity. Resting mast cells stimulated with beta-adrenergic agonists demonstrate a marked rise in cAMP levels after a 15-sec incubation. However, the same concentrations of these agonists have no effect on IgE-mediated mast cell histamine release. [3H]DHA binding to intact mast cells is rapid, reversible, saturable, and stereoselective. The cells possess 40,000 +/- 14,000 beta-adrenergic receptors/cell and demonstrate a binding affinity of 1.58 +/- 0.56 nM for [3H]DHA. Competition studies reveal that 83.5\% of the receptors are of the beta 2 subtype and 16.5\% are beta 1. Neither sensitization with anti-DNP-BSA IgE nor subsequent challenge with specific antigen alters mast cell beta-adrenergic receptor characteristics. Rat mast cells possesses large numbers of high affinity beta-adrenergic receptors, primarily of the beta 2 subtype, coupled to adenylate cyclase, but the role of these receptors in mast cell secretory events is not yet established.},

@article{Kroeger2001,
abstract = {The ability of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to interact to form new functional structures, either forming oligomers with themselves or forming associations with other intracellular proteins, has important implications for the regulation of cellular events; however, little is known about how this occurs. Here, we have employed a newly emerging technology, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), used to study protein-protein interactions in living cells, to demonstrate that the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (TRHR) forms constitutive homo-oligomers. This formation of TRHR homo-oligomers in the absence of ligand was shown by demonstration of an energy transfer between TRHR molecules fused to either donor, Renilla luciferase (Rluc) or acceptor, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) molecules. This interaction was shown to be specific, since energy transfer was not detected between co-expressed tagged TRHRs and either complementary tagged gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or beta(2)-adrenergic receptors. Furthermore, generation of a BRET signal between the TRHRs could only be inhibited by co-expression of the wild-type TRHR and not by other GPCRs. Agonist stimulation led to a time- and dose-dependent increase in the amount of energy transfer. Inhibition of receptor internalization by co-expression of dynamin mutant K44A did not affect the interaction between TRHRs, suggesting that clustering of receptors within clathrin-coated pits is not sufficient for energy transfer to occur. BRET also provided evidence for the agonist-induced oligomerization of another GPCR, the GnRH receptor (GnRHR), and the presence of an agonist-induced interaction of the adaptor protein, beta-arrestin, with TRHR and the absence of an interaction of beta-arrestin with GnRHR. This study supports the usefulness of BRET as a powerful tool for studying GPCR aggregations and receptor/protein interactions in general and presents evidence that the functioning unit of TRHRs exists as homomeric complexes.},

Here, we report the use of directed evolution and two different selection systems to further increase the activity of AGT towards BG derivatives by a factor of 17 and demonstrate the advantages of this mutant for the specific labeling of AGT fusion proteins displayed on the surface of mammalian cells. The results furthermore identify two regions of the protein outside the active site that influence the activity of the protein towards BG derivatives.},

abstract = {GPCRs are a major family of homologous proteins and are key mediators of the effects of numerous endogenous neurotransmitters, hormones, cytokines, therapeutic drugs, and drugs-of-abuse. Despite the enormous amount of research on the pharmacological and biochemical properties of GPCRs, the question as to whether they exist as monomers, dimers, or higher order structures in the body is unanswered. The GPCR dimer field has been dominated by techniques involving recombinant cell lines expressing mutant receptors, often involving the solubilization of the receptors. These techniques cannot be applied in vivo or even to primary cell cultures. This review will focus on a novel approach to exploring the functional properties of homodimers. Studies of the 5-HT(7) and 5-HT(2A) serotonin receptors have revealed that binding of a pseudo-irreversible antagonist ("inactivator") to one of the orthosteric sites of a homodimer abolishes all receptor activity, and subsequent binding of a competitive antagonist to the orthosteric site of the second protomer releases the inactivator, allowing the receptor to return to an active state. This approach demonstrates allosteric crosstalk between protomers of native GPCR homodimers, indicating that GPCRs do exist and function as homodimers in both recombinant cells and rat primary astrocytes. This technique can be applied universally using intact recombinant or primary cells in culture, membrane homogenate preparations and, potentially, in vivo. The data obtained using the 5-HT(7) and 5-HT(2A) receptors are strongly supportive of a GPCR homodimer structure, with little evidence of monomer involvement in the function of these receptors.},

abstract = {Translocation of membrane-impermeant molecules to the interior of living cells is a necessity for many biochemical investigations. Myristoylation was studied as a means to introduce peptides into living cells. Uptake of a myristoylated, fluorescent peptide was efficient in the B lymphocyte cell line BA/F3. In contrast, this cell line was resistant to uptake of a cell-penetrating peptide derived from the TAT protein. In BA/F3 cells, membrane association was shown to be rapid, reaching a maximum within 30 min. Cellular uptake of the peptide lagged the membrane association but occurred within a similar time frame. Experiments performed at 37 versus 4 degrees C demonstrated profound temperature dependence in the cellular uptake of myristoylated cargo. Myristoylated peptides with either positive or negative charge were shown to load efficiently. In contrast to TAT-conjugated cargo, pyrenebutyrate did not enhance cellular uptake of the myristoylated peptide. The myristoylated peptide did not adversely affect cell viability at concentrations up to 100 muM. This assessment of myristoyl-based transport provides fundamental data needed in understanding the intracellular delivery of myristoylated peptide cargoes for cell-based biochemical studies.},

abstract = {The psychosis associated with schizophrenia is characterized by alterations in sensory processing and perception. Some antipsychotic drugs were identified by their high affinity for serotonin 5-HT2A receptors (2AR). Drugs that interact with metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) also have potential for the treatment of schizophrenia. The effects of hallucinogenic drugs, such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide, require the 2AR and resemble some of the core symptoms of schizophrenia. Here we show that the mGluR2 interacts through specific transmembrane helix domains with the 2AR, a member of an unrelated G-protein-coupled receptor family, to form functional complexes in brain cortex. The 2AR-mGluR2 complex triggers unique cellular responses when targeted by hallucinogenic drugs, and activation of mGluR2 abolishes hallucinogen-specific signalling and behavioural responses. In post-mortem human brain from untreated schizophrenic subjects, the 2AR is upregulated and the mGluR2 is downregulated, a pattern that could predispose to psychosis. These regulatory changes indicate that the 2AR-mGluR2 complex may be involved in the altered cortical processes of schizophrenia, and this complex is therefore a promising new target for the treatment of psychosis.},

abstract = {The critical involvement of GPCRs (G-protein-coupled receptors) in nearly all physiological processes, and the presence of these receptors at the interface between the extracellular and the intracellular milieu, has positioned these receptors as pivotal therapeutic targets. Although a large number of drugs targeting GPCRs are currently available, significant efforts have been directed towards understanding receptor properties, with the goal of identifying and designing improved receptor ligands. Recent advances in GPCR pharmacology have demonstrated that different ligands binding to the same receptor can activate discrete sets of downstream effectors, a phenomenon known as 'ligand-directed signal specificity', which is currently being explored for drug development due to its potential therapeutic advantage. Emerging studies suggest that GPCR responses can also be modulated by contextual factors, such as interactions with other GPCRs. Association between different GPCR types leads to the formation of complexes, or GPCR heteromers, with distinct and unique signalling properties. Some of these heteromers activate discrete sets of signalling effectors upon activation by the same ligand, a phenomenon termed 'heteromer-directed signalling specificity'. This has been shown to be involved in the physiological role of receptors and, in some cases, in disease-specific dysregulation of a receptor effect. Hence targeting GPCR heteromers constitutes an emerging strategy to select receptor-specific responses and is likely to be useful in achieving specific beneficial therapeutic effects.},

abstract = {Site-directed mutagenesis guided by evolutionary trace analysis revealed that substitution of V179 and W183 within a cluster of evolutionarily important residues on the surface of the fourth transmembrane domain of the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (beta(1)AR) significantly reduced the propensity of the receptor to self-assemble into homodimers as assessed by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer in living cells. These results suggest that mutation of V179 and W183 result in conformational changes that reduce homodimerization either directly by interfering with the dimerization interface or indirectly by causing local misfolding that result in reduced self-assembly. However, the mutations did not cause a general misfolding of the beta(1)AR as they did not prevent heterodimerization with the beta(2)AR. The homodimerization-compromised mutants were significantly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and could not be properly matured and trafficked to the cell surface. Lipophilic beta-adrenergic ligands acted as pharmacological chaperones by restoring both dimerization and plasma membrane trafficking of the ER-retained dimerization-compromised beta(1)AR mutants. These results clearly indicate that homodimerization occurs early in the biosynthetic process in the ER and that pharmacological chaperones can promote both dimerization and cell surface targeting, most likely by stabilizing receptor conformations compatible with the two processes.},

@article{Hebert1996,
abstract = {One of the assumptions of the mobile receptor hypothesis as it relates to G protein-coupled receptors is that the stoichiometry of receptor, G protein, and effector is 1:1:1 (Bourne, H. R., Sanders, D. A., and McCormick, F.(1990) Nature 348, 125-132). Many studies on the cooperativity of agonist binding are incompatible with this notion and have suggested that both G proteins and their associated receptors can be oligomeric. However, a clear physical demonstration that G protein-coupled receptors can indeed interact as dimers and that such interactions may have functional consequences was lacking. Here, using differential epitope tagging we demonstrate that beta2-adrenergic receptors do form SDS-resistant homodimers and that transmembrane domain VI of the receptor may represent part of an interface for receptor dimerization. The functional importance of dimerization is supported by the observation that a peptide derived from this domain that inhibits dimerization also inhibits beta-adrenergic agonist-promoted stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity. Moreover, agonist stimulation was found to stabilize the dimeric state of the receptor, while inverse agonists favored the monomeric species, which suggests that interconversion between monomeric and dimeric forms may be important for biological activity.},

abstract = {In its native form, the chemokine CX3CL1 is a firmly adhesive molecule promoting leukocyte adhesion and migration and hence involved, along with its unique receptor CX3CR1, in various inflammatory processes. Here we investigated the role of molecular aggregation in the CX3CL1 adhesiveness. Assays of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) and homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) in transfected cell lines and in primary cells showed specific signals indicative of CX3CL1 clustering. Truncation experiments showed that the transmembrane domain played a central role in this aggregation. A chimera with mutations of the 12 central transmembrane domain residues had significantly reduced BRET signals and characteristics of a non-clustering molecule. This mutant was weakly adhesive according to flow and dual pipette adhesion assays and was less glycosylated than CX3CL1, although, as we demonstrated, loss of glycosylation did not affect the CX3CL1 adhesive potency. We postulate that cell surfaces express CX3CL1 as a constitutive oligomer and that this oligomerization is essential for its adhesive potency. Inhibition of CX3CL1 self-assembly could limit the recruitment of CX3CR1-positive cells and may be a new pathway for anti-inflammatory therapies.},

@article{Andre1996,
abstract = {Up to now, transgenic mice models created to study the physiological impact of alterations in the human beta-adrenoceptor system have only focused on cardiac tissues and carried hybrid transgenes with strong cardiac promoters. We have developed a transgenic mouse strain (F28) carrying the human beta 2-adrenoceptor gene with its natural promoter region with the aim of producing a model that more closely reproduces the natural human beta 2-adrenoceptor tissue expression pattern. By means of northern blot analyses, using the appropriate probes, we have obtained evidence that (a) the human beta 2-adrenoceptor's structural gene is transcribed in several tissues of F28 mice; (b) the tissue distribution pattern of human beta 2-adrenoceptor mRNA in F28 mice completely differs from that of mouse beta 2-adrenoceptor mRNA; and (c) the tissue distribution pattern of mouse beta 2-adrenoceptor mRNA in F28 mice is very similar to that observed in their non-transgenic littermates. Like humans, F28 mice express human beta 2-adrenoceptor mRNA in liver, lung, brain, heart, and muscle. However, unlike humans, F28 mice do not accumulate human beta 2-adrenoceptor mRNA in kidney and spleen. By using [125I]iodocyanopindolol to label all beta-adrenoceptors and ICI 118,551 to discriminate between the binding to beta 2- and beta 1-adrenoceptors we have demonstrated that the beta 2-adrenoceptor binding activity increases over control values in F28 mouse tissues that accumulate transgenic mRNA. Accordingly, the number of beta 2-adrenoceptors increased slightly over the control values in muscle, heart, brain, and lung of F28 mice, while in liver these receptors were strongly overexpressed. We further showed that transgene beta 2-adrenoceptors couple to GTP-binding proteins, mediate beta-adrenoceptor agonist-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activation, and cause a strong enhancement of this response in liver membranes of F28 versus control mice. Finally, F28 mice show a phenotype of depressed ponderal development and perturbed hindquarter movements. This unique model should be useful to further investigate beta 2-adrenoceptor causal relationships with human pathologies.},

Resonance energy transfer approaches represent a promising avenue to directly probe these interactions in real time. The present study aims at establishing a proof of principle that bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) can be used to study the regulation of protein-protein interaction in cells from transgenic animals. A transgenic mouse line coexpressing the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor fused to Renilla luciferase (beta(2)AR-Rluc) and beta arrestin-2 fused to a green fluorescent protein (GFP2-beta arr2) was generated. The fusion proteins were found to be functional in the transgenic animals and the beta(2)AR-Rluc maintained pharmacological properties, comparable to that of the native receptor. Sufficiently high luminescence signal was generated to allow detection of BRET in testis cells where the beta(2)AR-Rluc transgene was expressed at levels significantly higher than that of the endogenous receptor in this tissue but remain within physiological range when compared with other beta(2)AR-expressing tissues. Stimulation with a beta-adrenergic agonist led to a significant dose- and time-dependent increase in BRET, which reflected ligand-promoted recruitment of beta arr2 to the receptor. Our study demonstrates that BRET can be used to monitor the dynamic regulation of protein-protein interactions in cells derived from transgenic mice.},

abstract = {Hormones, sensory stimuli, neurotransmitters and chemokines signal by activating G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) [1]. Although GPCRs are thought to function as monomers, they can form SDS-resistant dimers, and coexpression of two non-functional or related GPCRs can result in rescue of activity or modification of function [2-10]. Furthermore, dimerization of peptides corresponding to the third cytoplasmic loops of GPCRs increases their potency as activators of G proteins in vitro [11], and peptide inhibitors of dimerization diminish beta(2)-adrenergic receptor signaling [3]. Nevertheless, it is not known whether GPCRs exist as monomers or oligomers in intact cells and membranes, whether agonist binding regulates monomer-oligomer equilibrium, or whether oligomerization governs GPCR function. Here, we report that the alpha-factor receptor, a GPCR that is the product of the STE2 gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is oligomeric in intact cells and membranes. Coexpression of receptors tagged with the cyan or yellow fluorescent proteins (CFP or YFP) resulted in efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) due to stable association rather than collisional interaction. Monomer-oligomer equilibrium was unaffected by binding of agonist, antagonist, or G protein heterotrimers. Oligomerization was further demonstrated by rescuing endocytosis-defective receptors with coexpressed wild-type receptors. Dominant-interfering receptor mutants inhibited signaling by interacting with wild-type receptors rather than by sequestering G protein heterotrimers. We suggest that oligomerization is likely to govern GPCR signaling and regulation.},

@article{Cottet2012,
abstract = {The concept of oligomerization of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) opens new perspectives regarding physiological function regulation. The capacity of one GPCR to modify its binding and coupling properties by interacting with a second one can be at the origin of regulations unsuspected two decades ago. Although the concept is interesting, its validation at a physiological level is challenging and probably explains why receptor oligomerization is still controversial. Demonstrating direct interactions between two proteins is not trivial since few techniques present a spatial resolution allowing this precision. Resonance energy transfer (RET) strategies are actually the most convenient ones. During the last two decades, bioluminescent resonance energy transfer and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) have been widely used since they exhibit high signal-to-noise ratio. Most of the experiments based on GPCR labeling have been performed in cell lines and it has been shown that all GPCRs have the propensity to form homo- or hetero-oligomers. However, whether these data can be extrapolated to GPCRs expressed in native tissues and explain receptor functioning in real life, remains an open question. Native tissues impose different constraints since GPCR sequences cannot be modified. Recently, a fluorescent ligand-based GPCR labeling strategy combined to a TR-FRET approach has been successfully used to prove the existence of GPCR oligomerization in native tissues. Although the RET-based strategies are generally quite simple to implement, precautions have to be taken before concluding to the absence or the existence of specific interactions between receptors. For example, one should exclude the possibility of collision of receptors diffusing throughout the membrane leading to a specific FRET signal. The advantages and the limits of different approaches will be reviewed and the consequent perspectives discussed.},

abstract = {Multiple and paradoxical effects of airway smooth muscle (ASM) 7-transmembrane-spanning receptors activated during asthma, or by treatment with bronchodilators such as beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR) agonists, indicate extensive receptor crosstalk. We examined the signaling of the prostanoid-EP(1) receptor, since its endogenous agonist prostaglandin E(2) is abundant in the airway, but its functional implications are poorly defined. Activation of EP(1) failed to elicit ASM contraction in mouse trachea via this G(alphaq)-coupled receptor. However, EP(1) activation markedly reduced the bronchodilatory function of beta(2)AR agonist, but not forskolin, indicating an early pathway interaction. Activation of EP(1) reduced beta(2)AR-stimulated cAMP in ASM but did not promote or augment beta(2)AR phosphorylation or alter beta(2)AR trafficking. Bioluminescence resonant energy transfer showed EP(1) and beta(2)AR formed heterodimers, which were further modified by EP(1) agonist. In cell membrane [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding studies, the presence of the EP(1) component of the dimer uncoupled beta(2)AR from G(alphas), an effect accentuated by EP(1) agonist activation. Thus alone, EP(1) does not appear to have a significant direct effect on airway tone but acts as a modulator of the beta(2)AR, altering G(alphas) coupling via steric interactions imposed by the EP(1):beta(2)AR heterodimeric signaling complex and ultimately affecting beta(2)AR-mediated bronchial relaxation. This mechanism may contribute to beta-agonist resistance found in asthma.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that beta(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated responses in human lung mast cells are highly variable. The aims of the present study were to establish whether polymorphisms of the beta (2)-adrenoceptor gene (ADRB2) influence this variability in (a) beta(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition and (b) desensitization of beta(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated responses in human lung mast cells.},

@article{Cottet2012a,
abstract = {The concept of oligomerization of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) opens new perspectives regarding physiological function regulation. The capacity of one GPCR to modify its binding and coupling properties by interacting with a second one can be at the origin of regulations unsuspected two decades ago. Although the concept is interesting, its validation at a physiological level is challenging and probably explains why receptor oligomerization is still controversial. Demonstrating direct interactions between two proteins is not trivial since few techniques present a spatial resolution allowing this precision. Resonance energy transfer (RET) strategies are actually the most convenient ones. During the last two decades, bioluminescent resonance energy transfer and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) have been widely used since they exhibit high signal-to-noise ratio. Most of the experiments based on GPCR labeling have been performed in cell lines and it has been shown that all GPCRs have the propensity to form homo- or hetero-oligomers. However, whether these data can be extrapolated to GPCRs expressed in native tissues and explain receptor functioning in real life, remains an open question. Native tissues impose different constraints since GPCR sequences cannot be modified. Recently, a fluorescent ligand-based GPCR labeling strategy combined to a TR-FRET approach has been successfully used to prove the existence of GPCR oligomerization in native tissues. Although the RET-based strategies are generally quite simple to implement, precautions have to be taken before concluding to the absence or the existence of specific interactions between receptors. For example, one should exclude the possibility of collision of receptors diffusing throughout the membrane leading to a specific FRET signal. The advantages and the limits of different approaches will be reviewed and the consequent perspectives discussed.},
