abstract = {G Protein-coupled receptor dimerization/oligomerization has been well established during the last several years. Studies have demonstrated the existence of dimers/digomers both in vitro and in living cells. However, a thorough characterization of the biochemical nature of receptor dimers and oligomers as well as their occurrence at the cell surface has not been properly addressed. In this study, we show that both beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) dimers and oligomers exist at the plasma membrane and that the detection of such species, following receptor solubilization and resolution by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), does not result from the formation of spurious disulfide bonds during cell lysis. Moreover, our results indicate that the biochemical nature of beta2AR dimers is different from that of the oligomers. Although both complexes are partially resistant to SDS denaturation, disulfide bonding is absolutely required for the stability of beta2AR oligomers but not dimers in SDS-PAGE. Indeed, dimeric species can be detected even in the presence of high concentrations of reducing and alkylating agents. Although the different biochemical nature of the dimers and oligomers may be indicative of distinct biological roles in cells, additional studies will be required to further elucidate the biosynthesis and function of these receptor forms.},

@article{Ferre2014,
abstract = {Most evidence indicates that, as for family C G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), family A GPCRs form homo- and heteromers. Homodimers seem to be a predominant species, with potential dynamic formation of higher-order oligomers, particularly tetramers. Although monomeric GPCRs can activate G proteins, the pentameric structure constituted by one GPCR homodimer and one heterotrimeric G protein may provide a main functional unit, and oligomeric entities can be viewed as multiples of dimers. It still needs to be resolved if GPCR heteromers are preferentially heterodimers or if they are mostly constituted by heteromers of homodimers. Allosteric mechanisms determine a multiplicity of possible unique pharmacological properties of GPCR homomers and heteromers. Some general mechanisms seem to apply, particularly at the level of ligand-binding properties. In the frame of the dimer-cooperativity model, the two-state dimer model provides the most practical method to analyze ligand-GPCR interactions when considering receptor homomers. In addition to ligand-binding properties, unique properties for each GPCR oligomer emerge in relation to different intrinsic efficacy of ligands for different signaling pathways (functional selectivity). This gives a rationale for the use of GPCR oligomers, and particularly heteromers, as novel targets for drug development. Herein, we review the functional and pharmacological properties of GPCR oligomers and provide some guidelines for the application of discrete direct screening and high-throughput screening approaches to the discovery of receptor-heteromer selective compounds.},

We immobilized a defined fraction of receptors with antibodies and then measured lateral mobility of the nonimmobilized fraction by FRAP. We validated this approach with CD86 and CD28 as monomeric and dimeric reference proteins, respectively. Di- or oligomerization of G protein-coupled receptors is strongly debated. We studied human beta-adrenergic receptors as prototypical G protein-coupled receptors and found that beta(1)-AR shows transient interactions whereas beta(2)-AR can form stable oligomers. We propose that this FRAP method can be widely applied to study di- or oligomerization of cell-surface proteins.},

abstract = {The concept of oligomerization of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) opens new perspectives regarding physiological function regulation. The capacity of one GPCR to modify its binding and coupling properties by interacting with a second one can be at the origin of regulations unsuspected two decades ago. Although the concept is interesting, its validation at a physiological level is challenging and probably explains why receptor oligomerization is still controversial. Demonstrating direct interactions between two proteins is not trivial since few techniques present a spatial resolution allowing this precision. Resonance energy transfer (RET) strategies are actually the most convenient ones. During the last two decades, bioluminescent resonance energy transfer and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) have been widely used since they exhibit high signal-to-noise ratio. Most of the experiments based on GPCR labeling have been performed in cell lines and it has been shown that all GPCRs have the propensity to form homo- or hetero-oligomers. However, whether these data can be extrapolated to GPCRs expressed in native tissues and explain receptor functioning in real life, remains an open question. Native tissues impose different constraints since GPCR sequences cannot be modified. Recently, a fluorescent ligand-based GPCR labeling strategy combined to a TR-FRET approach has been successfully used to prove the existence of GPCR oligomerization in native tissues. Although the RET-based strategies are generally quite simple to implement, precautions have to be taken before concluding to the absence or the existence of specific interactions between receptors. For example, one should exclude the possibility of collision of receptors diffusing throughout the membrane leading to a specific FRET signal. The advantages and the limits of different approaches will be reviewed and the consequent perspectives discussed.},

The structure and number of N-glycans per protein molecule cooperate to regulate lectin binding and thereby the distribution of glycoproteins at the cell surface. Congenital disorders of glycosylation provide insight as extreme hypomorphisms, whereas milder deficiencies may encompass many common chronic conditions, including autoimmunity, metabolic syndrome, and aging.},

abstract = {Recent studies demonstrate that members of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) form oligomers both in vitro and in vivo. The mechanisms by which GPCRs oligomerize and the roles of accessory proteins in this process are not well understood. We used disulfide-trapping experiments to show that C5a receptors, expressed in mammalian cells, reside in membranes as oligomers (Klco, J. M., Lassere, T. B., and Baranski, T. J. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 35345-35353). To begin to address how C5a receptors form oligomers, we now use fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments on human C5a receptors expressed in the lower eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. C5a receptors tagged with variants of the green fluorescent protein display energy transfer in intact yeast, demonstrating that mammalian accessory proteins are not required for C5a receptor oligomerization. In both intact yeast cells and membrane preparations, agonist does not affect FRET efficiency, and little energy transfer is observed between the C5a receptor and a co-expressed yeast pheromone receptor (encoded by STE2), indicating that C5a receptor oligomerization is both receptor-specific and constitutive. FRET studies performed on fractionated membranes demonstrate similar levels of energy transfer between tagged C5a receptors in endoplasmic reticulum compared with plasma membrane, and urea washing of membranes has little effect on the extent of energy transfer. The oligomerization of C5a receptors expressed in yeast displays characteristics similar to those observed for other GPCRs studied in mammalian cells. This model system should prove useful for further studies to define mechanisms of oligomerization of mammalian GPCRs.},

These experiments yield excellent quantitative data, but have low temporal and spatial resolution. In addition, the use of radioligands presents safety concerns. Here we provide a general procedure for an alternative approach with high temporal and spatial resolution, based on Tb(+)-labeled fluorescent receptor ligands and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET). This protocol and its design are detailed here for the parathyroid hormone receptor, a class B GPCR, and its fluorescently labeled 34-amino acid peptide ligand, but it can be easily modified for other receptors and their appropriately labeled ligands. We discuss three protocol options that use Tb(+)-labeled fluorescent ligands: a time-resolved fluorescence separation option that works on native receptors but requires separation of bound and unbound ligand; a TR-FRET option using SNAP-tag-labeled receptors for high-throughput screening; and a TR-FRET option that uses fluorescently labeled antibodies directed against an epitope engineered into the Flag-labeled receptors' N terminus. These protocol options can be used as standard procedures with very high signal-to-background ratios in order to characterize ligands and their receptors in living cells and in cell membranes via straightforward plate-reader measurements.},

In the absence of agonist, receptors tagged with monoclonal antibody remain in the plasma membrane for > 1 h. In the presence of agonist, tagged receptors are endocytosed within 10 min. Endocytosed receptors are located in endosomes and can be recycled to the plasma membrane. In the prolonged presence of agonist, receptor endocytosis continues even after maximum sequestration of surface receptors (measured by radioligand binding to intact cells) has occurred. The process of receptor endocytosis requires cellular ATP and is temperature-dependent. At 4 degrees C, no agonist-induced redistribution of receptors located in the plasma membrane is observed. At 16 degrees C, agonist causes receptors to cluster in and around coated invaginations of the plasma membrane, but receptor endocytosis does not occur. Agonist treatment of cells at 16 degrees C, but not 4 degrees C, predisposes receptors to agonist-independent endocytosis upon warming to 37 degrees C. These studies suggest that: 1) beta 2-adrenergic receptors reside stably in the plasma membrane of untreated cells, while they continuously cycle between the plasma membrane and endosomes in the presence of agonist; 2) agonist regulates an early step in the endocytosis mechanism, which is associated with the redistribution of adrenergic receptors between distinct microdomains of the plasma membrane; and 3) later steps in the endocytosis mechanism do not require agonist and may utilize the same endocytic machinery that mediates the endocytosis of constitutively recycling receptors.},

abstract = {The superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is very diverse in structure and function and its members are among the most pursued targets for drug development. We identified more than 800 human GPCR sequences and simultaneously analyzed 342 unique functional nonolfactory human GPCR sequences with phylogenetic analyses. Our results show, with high bootstrap support, five main families, named glutamate, rhodopsin, adhesion, frizzled/taste2, and secretin, forming the GRAFS classification system. The rhodopsin family is the largest and forms four main groups with 13 sub-branches. Positions of the GPCRs in chromosomal paralogons regions indicate the importance of tetraploidizations or local gene duplication events for their creation. We also searched for "fingerprint" motifs using Hidden Markov Models delineating the putative inter-relationship of the GRAFS families. We show several common structural features indicating that the human GPCRs in the GRAFS families share a common ancestor. This study represents the first overall map of the GPCRs in a single mammalian genome. Our novel approach of analyzing such large and diverse sequence sets may be useful for studies on GPCRs in other genomes and divergent protein families.},

abstract = {In the supernatant (30,000 x g) of frog erythrocyte homogenates, by using gel filtration we detected a protein that could bind [(3)H]dihydroalprenolol ([(3)H]DHA) with high affinity. This binding was greatly enhanced when the erythrocytes were preincubated with (-)-isoproterenol. After various periods of incubation with (-)-isoproterenol, the extent of the increase in the density of [(3)H]DHA binding sites in the cytosol was paralleled by a proportional decrease in the number of [(3)H]DHA binding sites in the corresponding pellet; both events peaked after 2-3 hr of incubation with (-)-isoproterenol. The K(a) of the (-)-isoproterenol-induced increase in [(3)H]DHA binding in cytosol and the decrease in this binding in the membrane ranged between 60 and 90 nM. The changes in the cytosol and particulate [(3)H]DHA binding sites were independent of RNA and protein synthesis. The increase in cytosol binding elicited by (-)-isoproterenol was blocked by exposure of the cells to (-)-alprenolol which per se failed to change the cytosol binding of [(3)H]DHA. Scatchard analysis revealed that the enhanced [(3)H]DHA binding to cytosol material was due to a 4-fold increase in the B(max) with little or no change in K(d) ( approximately 9 nM). Binding displacement data show that these soluble [(3)H]DHA binding sites resemble the surface membrane recognition sites. Moreover, the ability of various beta-adrenergic agents to increase [(3)H]DHA binding to cytosol after they were incubated with frog erythrocytes paralleled their affinity for membrane-bound beta receptors. These findings support the view that the beta-adrenergic receptor desensitization caused by prolonged exposure to (-)-isoproterenol is due, at least in part, to an internalization of the recognition site of beta-adrenergic receptors.},

A study in this issue of the JCI demonstrates how heterodimerization between prostaglandin E receptors and beta(2)-adrenergic receptors (beta(2)ARs) in airway smooth muscle cells results in uncoupling of beta(2)ARs and a diminished bronchodilator response to beta(2)AR agonists (see the related article beginning on page 1400). This illustrates what we believe to be a novel mechanism of receptor cross-talk and highlights the potential importance of GPCR heterodimerization in diseases such as asthma and how this could lead to the development of more specific therapies in the future.},

abstract = {The glucagon-like peptide-1 incretin receptor (GLP-1R) of family B G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a major drug target in type-2-diabetes due to its regulatory effect on post-prandial blood-glucose levels. The mechanism(s) controlling GLP-1R mediated signaling are far from fully understood. A fundamental mechanism controlling the signaling capacity of GPCRs is the post-endocytic trafficking of receptors between recycling and degradative fates. Here, we combined microscopy with novel real-time assays to monitor both receptor trafficking and signaling in living cells. We find that the human GLP-1R internalizes rapidly and with similar kinetics in response to equipotent concentrations of GLP-1 and the stable GLP-1 analogues exendin-4 and liraglutide. Receptor internalization was confirmed in mouse pancreatic islets. GLP-1R is shown to be a recycling receptor with faster recycling rates mediated by GLP-1 as compared to exendin-4 and liraglutide. Furthermore, a prolonged cycling of ligand-activated GLP-1Rs was observed and is suggested to be correlated with a prolonged cAMP signal. © 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Receptor-ligand interactions play a crucial role in biological systems and their measurement forms an important part of modern pharmaceutical development. Numerous assay formats are available that can be used to screen and quantify receptor ligands. In this review, we give an overview over both radioactive and non-radioactive assay technologies with emphasis on the latter. While radioreceptor assays are fast, easy to use and reproducible, their major disadvantage is that they are hazardous to human health, produce radioactive waste, require special laboratory conditions and are thus rather expensive on a large scale. This has led to the development of non-radioactive assays based on optical methods like fluorescence polarization, fluorescence resonance energy transfer or surface plasmon resonance. In light of their application in high-throughput screening environments, there has been an emphasis on so called "mix-and-measure" assays that do not require separation of bound from free ligand. The advent of recombinant production of receptors has contributed to the increased availability of specific assays and some aspects of the expression of recombinant receptors will be reviewed. Applications of receptor-ligand binding assays described in this review will relate to screening and the quantification of pharmaceuticals in biological matrices. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

To demonstrate their presence in native tissues, we developed a time-resolved FRET strategy that is based on receptor labeling with selective fluorescent ligands. Specific FRET signals were observed with four different receptors expressed in cell lines, consistent with their dimeric or oligomeric nature in these transfected cells. More notably, the comparison between FRET signals measured with sets of fluorescent agonists and antagonists was consistent with an asymmetric relationship of the two protomers in an activated GPCR dimer. Finally, we applied the strategy to native tissues and succeeded in demonstrating the presence of oxytocin receptor dimers and/or oligomers in mammary gland.},

Therefore, GPCRs are involved in diverse physiological processes and provide valuable drug targets for numerous diseases. Emerging body of evidence suggests that GPCRs exist as monomers or cross-react forming dimers and higher-ordered oligomers. In this Perspective we will review current biochemical and biophysical techniques to visualize GPCR dimerization, functional consequences of homo- and heterodimers, and approaches of medicinal chemists to target these receptor complexes with homo- and heterobivalent ligands.},

abstract = {RATIONALE The comprehensive evaluation of gene variation, haplotype structure, and linkage disequilibrium is important in understanding the function of beta2-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRbeta2) on disease susceptibility, pulmonary function, and therapeutic responses in different ethnic groups with asthma. OBJECTIVES To identify ADRbeta2 polymorphisms and haplotype structure in white and African American subjects and to test for genotype and haplotype association with asthma phenotypes. METHODS A 5.3-kb region of ADRbeta2 was resequenced in 669 individuals from 429 whites and 240 African Americans. A total of 12 polymorphisms, representing an optimal haplotype tagging set, were genotyped in whites (338 patients and 326 control subjects) and African Americans (222 patients and 299 control subjects). RESULTS A total of 49 polymorphisms were identified, 21 of which are novel; 31 polymorphisms (frequency > 0.03) were used to identify 24 haplotypes (frequency > 0.01) and assess linkage disequilibrium. Association with ratio (FEV1/FVC)2 for single-nucleotide polymorphism +79 (p < 0.05) was observed in African Americans. Significant haplotype association for (FEV1/FVC)2 was also observed in African Americans. CONCLUSIONS There are additional genetic variants besides +46 (Gly16Arg) that are important in determining asthma phenotypes. These data suggest that the length of a poly-C repeat (+1269) in the 3' untranslated region of ADRbeta2 may influence lung function, and may be important in delineating variation in beta-agonist responses, especially in African Americans.},

abstract = {Several examples of functional G-protein-coupled receptor heterodimers have been identified. However, it is not known whether receptor heterodimerization is involved in the pathogenesis of human disorders. Here we show that in preeclamptic hypertensive women, a significant increase in heterodimerization occurs between the AT(1)-receptor for the vasopressor angiotensin II and the B(2)-receptor for the vasodepressor bradykinin. AT(1)-B(2)-receptor heterodimerization in preeclampsia correlated with a 4-5-fold increase in B(2)-receptor protein levels. Expression of the AT(1)-B(2) heterodimer increased the responsiveness to angiotensin II and conferred resistance in AT(1)-receptors to inactivation by reactive oxygen species raised in normotensive and preeclamptic pregnancies. We suggest that AT(1)-B(2) heterodimers contribute to angiotensin II hypersensitivity in preeclampsia. Moreover, we identify preeclampsia as the first disorder associated with altered G-protein-coupled receptor heterodimerization.},

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) were long thought to be an exception, but in recent years a lot of evidence has accumulated that GPCRs also can form dimers, even though it is far from certain when and where they actually do so under physiological conditions. Dimerization of GPCRs does not generally seem to be required for ligand recognition or signaling. However, dimerization may serve to affect receptor mobility at the cell surface and in intracellular trafficking, and may be involved in and affect their signaling functions.},

abstract = {Adrenergic $\beta$2 receptor (ADR$\beta$2) agonists are widely used in asthma. Approximately 10{\%} of patients have severe, poorly controlled disease despite extensive use of ADR$\beta$2 agonists. Variations in responses to ADR$\beta$2 agonists can, in part, be attributed to genetic variation, with 49 different polymorphisms having been identified for the ADR$\beta$2 gene. Although clear associations exist between ADR$\beta$2 gene polymorphisms, such as +46G>A, and patient response, the importance of these polymorphisms remains controversial. Patient selection, the number of polymorphisms analysed, differences in the type/dose of ADR$\beta$2 agonist, use of inhaled corticosteroids and population sizes have all varied. Most studies were limited to mild or moderate asthmatics using ADR$\beta$2 agonists sparingly. It is difficult to extrapolate from these studies to individual patients who have severe asthma, use a variety of ADR$\beta$2 agonists and do so frequently. The extent to which ADR$\beta$2 gene polymorphisms are relevant to asthma management needs further review, both clinically and at the molecular level. In vitro studies have helped to define the functional changes induced by specific ADR$\beta$2 gene polymorphisms, including 3'-untranslated region poly-C repeat. The resulting ADR$\beta$2 gene haplotypes (rather than genotypes), the interactions among ADR$\beta$2 gene haplotypes and variations in the chemistry of different agonists deserve more detailed assessment. Responses to ADR$\beta$2 agonists depend on effective downstream signalling following ADR$\beta$2 activation and also on receptor regulation. Studies on other regulators of ADR$\beta$2 receptor signalling and trafficking may be equally important in understanding the functional role of ADR$\beta$2 gene polymorphisms. The role of ADR$\beta$2 gene polymorphisms in the pathogenesis and management of severe asthma cannot be clearly defined until more specific and targeted research studies are performed.},

abstract = {The C terminus of the beta(2)-adrenoceptor (AR) interacts with G protein-coupled receptor kinases and arrestins in an agonist-dependent manner, suggesting that conformational changes induced by ligands in the transmembrane domains are transmitted to the C terminus. We used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to examine ligand-induced structural changes in the distance between two positions on the beta(2)-AR C terminus and cysteine 265 (Cys-265) at the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane domain 6. The donor fluorophore FlAsH (Fluorescein Arsenical Helix binder) was attached to a CCPGCC motif introduced at position 351-356 in the proximal C terminus or at the distal C terminus. An acceptor fluorophore, Alexa Fluor 568, was attached to Cys-265. FRET analyses revealed that the average distances between Cys-265 and the proximal and distal FlAsH sites were 57 and 62A(,) respectively. These relatively large distances suggest that the C terminus is in an extended, relatively unstructured conformation. Nevertheless, we observed ligand-specific changes in FRET. All ligands induced an increase in FRET between the proximal C-terminal FlAsH site and Cys-265. Ligands that have been shown to induce arrestin-dependent ERK activation, including the catecholamine agonists and the inverse agonist ICI118551, led to a decrease in FRET between the distal FlAsH site and Cys-265, whereas other ligands had no effect or induced a small increase in FRET. Taken together the results provide new insight into the structure of the C terminus of the beta(2)-AR as well as ligand-induced conformational changes that may be relevant to arrestin-dependent regulation and signaling.},

An ideal tool for validating this concept pharmacologically would be a hetero-oligomer selective ligand. We set out to develop and execute a 1536-well high-throughput screen of over 1 million compounds to detect potential hetero-oligomer selective ligands using a $\beta$-arrestin recruitment assay in U2OS cells coexpressing recombinant µ- and $\delta$-opioid receptors. Hetero-oligomer selective ligands may bind to orthosteric or allosteric sites, and we might anticipate that the formation of hetero-oligomers may provide novel allosteric binding pockets for ligand binding. Therefore, our goal was to execute the screen in such a way as to identify positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) as well as agonists for µ, $\delta$, and hetero-oligomeric receptors. While no hetero-oligomer selective ligands were identified (based on our selection criteria), this single screen did identify numerous µ- and $\delta$-selective agonists and PAMs as well as nonselective agonists and PAMs. To our knowledge, these are the first µ- and $\delta$-opioid receptor PAMs described in the literature.},

abstract = {Agonist-induced internalization was observed for both inducible and constitutively expressed forms of the cannabinoid CB(1) receptor. These were also internalized by the peptide orexin A, which has no direct affinity for the cannabinoid CB(1) receptor, but only when the orexin OX(1) receptor was co-expressed along with the cannabinoid CB(1) receptor. This effect of orexin A was concentration-dependent and blocked by OX(1) receptor antagonists. Moreover, the ability of orexin A to internalize the CB(1) receptor was also blocked by CB(1) receptor antagonists. Remarkably, orexin A was substantially more potent in producing internalization of the CB(1) receptor than in causing internalization of the bulk OX(1) receptor population, and this was true in cells in which the CB(1) receptor was maintained at a constant level, whereas levels of OX(1) could be varied and vice versa. Both co-immunoprecipitation and cell surface, homogenous time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer based on covalent labeling of N-terminal "SNAP" and "CLIP" tags present in the extracellular N-terminal domain of the receptors confirmed the capacity of these two receptors to heteromultimerize. These studies confirm the capacity of the CB(1) and OX(1) receptors to interact directly and demonstrate that this complex has unique regulatory characteristics. The higher potency of the agonist orexin A to regulate the CB(1)-OX(1) heteromer compared with the OX(1)-OX(1) homomer present in the same cells and the effects of CB(1) receptor antagonists on the function of orexin A suggest an interplay between these two systems that may modulate appetite, feeding, and wakefulness.},

abstract = {Given the mounting evidence for involvement of delta opioid receptors in the tolerance and physical dependence of mu opioid receptor agonists, we have investigated the possible physical interaction between mu and delta opioid receptors by using bivalent ligands. Based on reports of suppression of antinociceptive tolerance by the delta antagonist naltrindole (NTI), bivalent ligands [mu-delta agonist-antagonist (MDAN) series] that contain different length spacers, and pharmacophores derived from NTI and the mu agonist oxymorphone, have been synthesized and evaluated by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration in the tail-flick test in mice. In acute i.c.v. studies, the bivalent ligands functioned as agonists with potencies ranging from 1.6- to 45-fold greater than morphine. In contrast, the monovalent mu agonist analogues were substantially more potent than the MDAN congeners and were essentially equipotent with one another and oxymorphone. Pretreatment with NTI decreased the ED(50) values for MDAN-19 to a greater degree than for MDAN-16 but had no effect on MDAN-21. Chronic i.c.v. studies revealed that MDAN ligands whose spacer was 16 atoms or longer produced less dependence than either morphine or mu monovalent control MA-19. On the other hand, both physical dependence and tolerance were suppressed at MDAN spacer lengths of 19 atoms or greater. These data suggest that physical interaction between the mu and delta opioid receptors modulates mu-mediated tolerance and dependence. Because MDAN-21 was found to be 50-fold more potent than morphine by the i.v. route (i.v.), it offers a previously uncharacterized approach for the development of analgesics devoid of tolerance and dependence.},

abstract = {There has been much speculation regarding the functional relevance of G protein-coupled receptor heterodimers, primarily because demonstrating their existence in vivo has proven to be a considerable challenge. Here we show that the opioid agonist ligand 6'-guanidinonaltrindole (6'-GNTI) has the unique property of selectively activating only opioid receptor heterodimers but not homomers. Importantly, 6'-GNTI is an analgesic, thereby demonstrating that opioid receptor heterodimers are indeed functionally relevant in vivo. However, 6'-GNTI induces analgesia only when it is administered in the spinal cord but not in the brain, suggesting that the organization of heterodimers is tissue-specific. This study demonstrates a proof of concept for tissue-selective drug targeting based on G protein-coupled receptor heterodimerization.

The past 4 years have seen remarkable progress in the structural biology of GPCRs, raising the possibility of applying structure-based approaches to GPCR drug discovery efforts. Of the various structure-based approaches that have been applied to soluble protein targets, such as proteases and kinases, in silico docking is among the most ready applicable to GPCRs. Early studies suggest that GPCR binding pockets are well suited to docking, and docking screens have identified potent and novel compounds for these targets. This review will focus on the current state of in silico docking for GPCRs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Most of the drugs that are currently used to treat airway diseases interact with receptors expressed by cells in the airways. This makes inhaled delivery efficient because it reaches the key target cells and has a low risk of systemic side effects. Both beta(2)-agonists and anticholinergics target autonomic receptors on airway smooth muscle of large and small airways. Inhaled beta(2)-agonists also interact with beta(2)-receptors expressed on other important target cells, including mast cells and postcapillary venules. Anticholinergic bronchodilators target M(3) muscarinic receptors on airway smooth muscle, which in small airways may be activated by extraneuronal acetylcholine. Corticosteroids target glucocorticoid receptors (GR), which are widely distributed so that they are best given by inhalation to interact with intracellular GR in the respiratory tract and to avoid side effects from activation of GR in extrapulmonary tissues such as bone. By contrast, cysteinyl-leukotriene 1 receptors are mainly expresses in airway smooth muscle so that antileukotrienes are less effective clinically than beta(2)-agonists and corticosteroids, but oral delivery is possible as there are minimal side effects. There are many other receptor targets in lung and for several of these receptors, such as receptors for chemotactic agonists, selective antagonists are in clinical development. For drugs that inhibit chemotactic receptors, systemic delivery is more appropriate to prevent the inflammatory cells that bear these receptors from being recruited into the airways by locally released chemotactic factors. Many novel receptors, including orphan receptors, have now been identified as these may be future targets for developing novel therapies for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.},

abstract = {Background and purpose. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) and $\beta$-adrenoceptors in the airways and lungs are clinically important in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. However, the quantitative and qualitative estimation of these receptors by radioligand binding approaches in human airways has not yet been reported because of tissue limitations. Experimental approach. The regional distribution and relative proportion of mAChR and $\beta$-adrenoceptor subtypes were evaluated in human bronchus and lung parenchyma by a tissue segment binding method with [(3) H]-N-methylscopolamine ([(3) H]-NMS) for mAChRs and with [(3) H]-CGP-12,177 for $\beta$-adrenoceptors. Functional responses to carbachol and isoproterenol were also analyzed in the bronchus. Key Results. M(3) subtype predominantly occurred in the bronchus, but the density decreased from the segmental to subsegmental bronchus, and was abolished in lung parenchyma. On the other hand, the M(1) subtype occurred in the lung only, and the M(2) subtype was distributed ubiquitously in the bronchus and lungs. $\beta$(2) -adrenoceptors were increased along the airways, and their densities in the subsegmental bronchus and lung parenchyma were approximately two-fold higher than those of mAChRs in the same region. $\beta$(1) -adrenoceptors also existed in lung parenchyma but were undetectable in the bronchus. The muscarinic contractions and adrenergic relaxations in both bronchial regions were mediated through M(3) -mAChRs and $\beta$(2) -adrenoceptors, respectively. Conclusions and Implications. From the present radioligand binding approach with intact tissue segments, we constructed a distribution map of mAChRs and $\beta$-adrenoceptors in human bronchus and lung parenchyma for the first time, providing important evidence for future pharmacotherapy and new drug development for respiratory disorders. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {The ability of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to interact to form new functional structures, either forming oligomers with themselves or forming associations with other intracellular proteins, has important implications for the regulation of cellular events; however, little is known about how this occurs. Here, we have employed a newly emerging technology, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), used to study protein-protein interactions in living cells, to demonstrate that the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (TRHR) forms constitutive homo-oligomers. This formation of TRHR homo-oligomers in the absence of ligand was shown by demonstration of an energy transfer between TRHR molecules fused to either donor, Renilla luciferase (Rluc) or acceptor, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) molecules. This interaction was shown to be specific, since energy transfer was not detected between co-expressed tagged TRHRs and either complementary tagged gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or beta(2)-adrenergic receptors. Furthermore, generation of a BRET signal between the TRHRs could only be inhibited by co-expression of the wild-type TRHR and not by other GPCRs. Agonist stimulation led to a time- and dose-dependent increase in the amount of energy transfer. Inhibition of receptor internalization by co-expression of dynamin mutant K44A did not affect the interaction between TRHRs, suggesting that clustering of receptors within clathrin-coated pits is not sufficient for energy transfer to occur. BRET also provided evidence for the agonist-induced oligomerization of another GPCR, the GnRH receptor (GnRHR), and the presence of an agonist-induced interaction of the adaptor protein, beta-arrestin, with TRHR and the absence of an interaction of beta-arrestin with GnRHR. This study supports the usefulness of BRET as a powerful tool for studying GPCR aggregations and receptor/protein interactions in general and presents evidence that the functioning unit of TRHRs exists as homomeric complexes.},

abstract = {HTRF (Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence) is the most frequently used generic assay technology to measure analytes in a homogenous format, which is the ideal platform used for drug target studies in high-throughput screening (HTS). This technology combines fluorescence resonance energy transfer technology (FRET) with time-resolved measurement (TR). In TR-FRET assays, a signal is generated through fluorescent resonance energy transfer between a donor and an acceptor molecule when in close proximity to each other. Buffer and media interference is dramatically reduced by dual-wavelength detection, and the final signal is proportional to the extent of product formation. The HTRF assay is usually sensitive and robust that can be miniaturized into the 384 and 1536-well plate formats. This assay technology has been applied to many antibody-based assays including GPCR signaling (cAMP and IP-One), kinases, cytokines and biomarkers, bioprocess (antibody and protein production), as well as the assays for protein-protein, proteinpeptide, and protein-DNA/RNA interactions.Since its introduction to the drug-screening world over ten years ago, researchers have used HTRF to expedite the study of GPCRs, kinases, new biomarkers, protein-protein interactions, and other targets of interest. HTRF has also been utilized as an alternative method for bioprocess monitoring. The first-generation HTRF technology, which uses Europium cryptate as a fluorescence donor to monitor reactions between biomolecules, was extended in 2008 through the introduction of a second-generation donor, Terbium cryptate (Tb), enhancing screening performance. Terbium cryptate possesses different photophysical properties compared to Europium, including increased quantum yield and a higher molar extinction coefficient. In addition to being compatible with the same acceptor fluorophors used with Europium, it can serve as a donor fluorophore to green-emitting fluors because it has multiple emission peaks including one at 490 nm. Moreover, all Terbium HTRF assays can be read on the same HTRF-compatible instruments as Europium HTRF assays.Overall, HTRF is a highly sensitive, robust technology for the detection of molecular interactions in vitro and is widely used for primary and secondary screening phases of drug development. This review addresses the general principles of HTRF and its current applications in drug discovery.},

abstract = {We have recently delineated three naturally occurring polymorphisms of the human beta 2-adrenergic receptor caused by missense mutations encoding for amino acids 16 and 27 of the extracellular N-terminus of the receptor. We have studied the functional consequences of these polymorphisms by site-directed mutagenesis and the recombinant expression of these receptors in Chinese hamster fibroblasts. The polymorphisms consist of substitutions of Gly for Arg at amino acid 16 (Arg16-->Gly), Glu for Gln at amino acid 27 (Gln27-->Glu), and a combination of both substitutions. All three mutated receptors displayed normal agonist binding and functional coupling to Gs, resulting in the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity. However, these mutations markedly altered the degree of agonist-promoted downregulation of receptor expression. After 24-h exposure to 10 microM isoproterenol, wild-type beta 2AR underwent a 26 +/- 3{\%} reduction in receptor density. In contrast, Arg16-->Gly underwent a 41 +/- 3{\%} reduction. Gln27-->Glu, on the other hand, was found to be completely resistant to downregulation. Arg16-->Gly+Gln27-->Glu also underwent an increased downregulation compared to wild-type beta 2AR (39 +/- 4{\%}). The rates of new receptor synthesis after irreversible alkylation were not different between these receptors, nor were the rates of agonist-promoted receptor internalization to the intracellular pool. Gln27-->Glu cellular mRNA minimally increased during agonist exposure, and wild-type beta 2AR and the other mutated receptor mRNAs did not change, which infer that the aberrant downregulation patterns of these polymorphisms may be due to the altered degradation of receptor protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we found that the $\beta$(2)-adrenergic receptor ($\beta$(2)AR) responded to repeated activation with altered activation kinetics. Polymorphic variants of the $\beta$(2)AR displayed divergent changes of $\beta$(2)AR activation kinetics that closely mimicked their different efficacies to generate cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. More efficacious variants became faster in their activation kinetics, whereas less efficacious variants became slower, compared to their initial activation. These differences depended on phosphorylation of the receptor by G protein-coupled receptor kinases. Our findings suggest an intrinsic, polymorphism-specific property of the $\beta$(2)AR that alters activation kinetics upon continued stimulation and that may account for individual drug responses.},

abstract = {GPCRs are a major family of homologous proteins and are key mediators of the effects of numerous endogenous neurotransmitters, hormones, cytokines, therapeutic drugs, and drugs-of-abuse. Despite the enormous amount of research on the pharmacological and biochemical properties of GPCRs, the question as to whether they exist as monomers, dimers, or higher order structures in the body is unanswered. The GPCR dimer field has been dominated by techniques involving recombinant cell lines expressing mutant receptors, often involving the solubilization of the receptors. These techniques cannot be applied in vivo or even to primary cell cultures. This review will focus on a novel approach to exploring the functional properties of homodimers. Studies of the 5-HT(7) and 5-HT(2A) serotonin receptors have revealed that binding of a pseudo-irreversible antagonist ("inactivator") to one of the orthosteric sites of a homodimer abolishes all receptor activity, and subsequent binding of a competitive antagonist to the orthosteric site of the second protomer releases the inactivator, allowing the receptor to return to an active state. This approach demonstrates allosteric crosstalk between protomers of native GPCR homodimers, indicating that GPCRs do exist and function as homodimers in both recombinant cells and rat primary astrocytes. This technique can be applied universally using intact recombinant or primary cells in culture, membrane homogenate preparations and, potentially, in vivo. The data obtained using the 5-HT(7) and 5-HT(2A) receptors are strongly supportive of a GPCR homodimer structure, with little evidence of monomer involvement in the function of these receptors.},

CPPs are rich in basic amino acids such as arginine and lysine and are able to translocate over membranes and gain access to the cell interior. They can deliver large-cargo molecules, such as oligonucleotides, into cells. Endocytosis and direct penetration have been suggested as the two major uptake mechanisms, a subject still under debate. Unresolved questions include the detailed molecular uptake mechanism(s), reasons for cell toxicity, and the delivery efficiency of CPPs for different cargoes. Here, we give a review focused on uptake mechanisms used by CPPs for membrane translocation and certain experimental factors that affect the mechanism(s).},

abstract = {The serotonin(1A) receptor is a representative member of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily and serves as an important target in the development of therapeutic agents for neuropsychiatric disorders. Oligomerization of GPCRs is an important contemporary issue since it is believed to be a crucial determinant for cellular signaling. In this work, we monitored the oligomerization status of the serotonin(1A) receptor tagged to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (5-HT(1A)R-EYFP) in live cells utilizing time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy decay. We interpret the unresolved fast component of the observed anisotropy decay as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between 5-HT(1A)R-EYFP molecules (homo-FRET). Homo-FRET enjoys certain advantages over hetero-FRET in the analysis of receptor oligomerization. Our results reveal the presence of constitutive oligomers of the serotonin(1A) receptor in live cells. We further show that the oligomerization status of the receptor is independent of ligand stimulation and sphingolipid depletion. Interestingly, acute (but not chronic) cholesterol depletion appears to enhance the oligomerization process. Importantly, our results are independent of receptor expression level, thereby ruling out complications arising due to high expression. These results have potential implications in future therapeutic strategies in pathophysiological conditions in which serotonin(1A) receptors are implicated.},

abstract = {The psychosis associated with schizophrenia is characterized by alterations in sensory processing and perception. Some antipsychotic drugs were identified by their high affinity for serotonin 5-HT2A receptors (2AR). Drugs that interact with metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) also have potential for the treatment of schizophrenia. The effects of hallucinogenic drugs, such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide, require the 2AR and resemble some of the core symptoms of schizophrenia. Here we show that the mGluR2 interacts through specific transmembrane helix domains with the 2AR, a member of an unrelated G-protein-coupled receptor family, to form functional complexes in brain cortex. The 2AR-mGluR2 complex triggers unique cellular responses when targeted by hallucinogenic drugs, and activation of mGluR2 abolishes hallucinogen-specific signalling and behavioural responses. In post-mortem human brain from untreated schizophrenic subjects, the 2AR is upregulated and the mGluR2 is downregulated, a pattern that could predispose to psychosis. These regulatory changes indicate that the 2AR-mGluR2 complex may be involved in the altered cortical processes of schizophrenia, and this complex is therefore a promising new target for the treatment of psychosis.},

abstract = {Although homodimerization has been demonstrated for a large number of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), no general role has been attributed to this process. Because it is known that oligomerization plays a key role in the quality control and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) export of many proteins, we sought to determine if homodimerization could play such a role in GPCR biogenesis. Using the beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) as a model, cell fractionation studies revealed that receptor homodimerization is an event occurring as early as the ER. Supporting the hypothesis that receptor homodimerization is involved in ER processing, beta2AR mutants lacking an ER-export motif or harboring a heterologous ER-retention signal dimerized with the wild-type receptor and inhibited its trafficking to the cell surface. Finally, in addition to inhibiting receptor dimerization, disruption of the putative dimerization motif, 276GXXXGXXXL284, prevented normal trafficking of the receptor to the plasma membrane. Taken together, these data indicate that beta2AR homodimerization plays an important role in ER export and cell surface targeting.},

abstract = {Behavioral and microdialysis studies have been performed on antagonistic A(2A)/D(2) interactions in animal models of Parkinson's Disease. The behavioral analysis involved studies on locomotor activity in reserpinized mice, haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats and rotational behavior in rats with unilateral 6-OHDA lesions of the ascending DA pathways (Ungerstedt model). Dual probe microdialysis studies were indirectly performed on the striatopallidal GABA neurons by studying extracellular glutamate levels in the striatum and globus pallidus of the awake freely moving rat. The striatum was perfused with A(2A) and/or D(2) agonists via reverse microdialysis. The results show that the A(2A) antagonists SCH58261 and KF17837 can increase locomotor activity in reserpinized mice and produce contralateral rotational behavior only after administration of subthreshold doses of l-DOPA or the D(2) like agonist quinpirole. Furthermore, antagonizing the A(2A) receptor (R) reduced haloperidol induced catalepsy. The behavioral results underline the view that A(2A) antagonists act by blocking A(2A) R in A(2A)/D(2) heterodimers where A(2A) R inhibits the D(2) R transduction and D(2) inhibits the adenylate cyclase (AC) activated by A(2A) R. The microdialysis studies show that the A(2A) agonist CGS21680 striatally coperfused with the D(2) agonist quinpirole more potently counteract the D(2) agonist (quinpirole) induced reduction of pallidal glutamate levels in the DA denervated vs the control striatum indicating an enhancement of the inhibitory A(2A)/D(2) interaction. In the DA denervated but not in the control striatum the A(2A) agonist CGS21680 could strongly increase striatal glutamate levels, indicating an increased receptor signaling in the A(2A) R located on the striatal glutamate terminals, where also D(2) like R exist, here probably as D(4). Thus, the signaling of this A(2A) R may be set free by the loss of D(4) tone on the AC activated by A(2A) in this postulated A(2A)/D(4) heteromer on the glutamate terminals. Taken together, the results indicate that the antiparkinsonian actions of A(2A) antagonists probably are produced by blockade of A(2A) R in the A(2A)/D(2) heterodimers mainly located in the striatopallidal GABA neurons.},

abstract = {Monitoring the dynamics of protein-protein interactions in their natural environment remains a challenge. Resonance energy transfer approaches represent a promising avenue to directly probe these interactions in real time. The present study aims at establishing a proof of principle that bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) can be used to study the regulation of protein-protein interaction in cells from transgenic animals. A transgenic mouse line coexpressing the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor fused to Renilla luciferase (beta(2)AR-Rluc) and beta arrestin-2 fused to a green fluorescent protein (GFP2-beta arr2) was generated. The fusion proteins were found to be functional in the transgenic animals and the beta(2)AR-Rluc maintained pharmacological properties, comparable to that of the native receptor. Sufficiently high luminescence signal was generated to allow detection of BRET in testis cells where the beta(2)AR-Rluc transgene was expressed at levels significantly higher than that of the endogenous receptor in this tissue but remain within physiological range when compared with other beta(2)AR-expressing tissues. Stimulation with a beta-adrenergic agonist led to a significant dose- and time-dependent increase in BRET, which reflected ligand-promoted recruitment of beta arr2 to the receptor. Our study demonstrates that BRET can be used to monitor the dynamic regulation of protein-protein interactions in cells derived from transgenic mice.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a heteromeric D1-D2 dopamine receptor signaling complex in brain that is coupled to Gq/11 and requires agonist binding to both receptors for G protein activation and intracellular calcium release. The D1 agonist SKF83959 was identified as a specific agonist for the heteromer that activated Gq/11 by functioning as a full agonist for the D1 receptor and a high-affinity partial agonist for a pertussis toxin-resistant D2 receptor within the complex. We provide evidence that the D1-D2 signaling complex can be more readily detected in mice that are 8 months in age compared with animals that are 3 months old, suggesting that calcium signaling through the D1-D2 dopamine receptor complex is relevant for function in the postadolescent brain. Activation of Gq/11 through the heteromer increases levels of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIalpha in the nucleus accumbens, unlike activation of Gs/olf-coupled D1 receptors, indicating a mechanism by which D1-D2 dopamine receptor complexes may contribute to synaptic plasticity.},

They regulate virtually all physiological processes in mammals. Yet as recently as 40 years ago their very existence was still in question. One class of receptors, those coupled to G proteins (also known as GPCRs or seven transmembrane receptors) comprise by far the largest group (approx. 1000), and are the most important target of clinically used drugs. Here I provide a very personal retrospective of research over the past 35 years which ultimately led to the identification, purification, reconstitution and cloning of the adrenergic receptors; the discovery of their homology with the seven transmembrane spanning visual light receptor rhodopsin and the realization that there was a large gene family of G protein coupled receptors; the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of receptor desensitization and signalling through G protein-coupled receptor kinases and beta-arrestins; and the appreciation that the structure, signalling, and regulatory mechanisms of the receptors are all highly conserved across the large receptor superfamily.},

abstract = {Olfactory receptors (ORs) comprise more than half of the large class I G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. Although cloned over a decade ago, little is known about their properties because wild-type ORs do not efficiently reach the cell surface following heterologous expression. Receptor-receptor interactions strongly influence surface trafficking of other GPCRs, and we examined whether a similar mechanism might be involved in OR surface expression. Olfactory neurons are known to express beta-adrenergic receptors (ARs), and we found that coexpression with beta(2)-ARs, but not any other AR subtypes, dramatically increased mouse 71 (M71) OR surface expression in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. A persistent physical interaction between M71 ORs and beta(2)-ARs was shown by coimmunoprecipitation and by cointernalization of the two receptors in response to their specific ligands. Also, coexpression of wild-type M71 ORs with beta(2)-ARs resulted in cAMP responses to the M71 ligand acetophenone. Finally, in situ hybridization studies showed extensive colocalization of M71 OR and beta(2)-AR expression in mouse olfactory epithelium. These data demonstrate the successful heterologous surface expression of a functional wild-type OR and reveal that persistent physical association with other GPCRs can control OR surface expression.},

abstract = {A range of studies have indicated that many rhodopsin-like, family A G protein-coupled receptors, including the ??2-adrenoceptor, exist and probably function as dimers. It is less clear if receptors internalize as dimers and if agonist occupancy of only one element of a dimer is sufficient to cause internalization of a receptor dimer into the cell. We have used a chemogenomic approach to demonstrate that this is the case. Following expression of the wild type ??2-adrenoceptor, isoprenaline but not 1-(3???'4???-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-methyl-1-butanone, which does not have significant affinity for the wild type receptor, caused receptor internalization. By contrast, 1-(3???4???-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-methyl-1-butanone, but not isoprenaline that does not have high affinity for the mutated receptor, caused internalization of Asp113Ser??2-adrenoceptor. Following co-expression of wild type and Asp113Ser??2-adrenoceptors each of isoprenaline and 1-(3???4???-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-methyl-1-butanone caused the co-internalization of both of these two forms of the receptor. Co-expressed wild type and Asp113Ser??2-adrenoceptors were able to be co-immunoprecipitated and 1-(3???4???-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-methyl-1-butanone produced internalization of the wild type receptor that was not prevented by the ??-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol that binds with high affinity only to the wild type receptor. These results demonstrate that agonist occupancy of either single binding site of the ??2-adrenoceptor dimer is sufficient to cause internalization of the dimer and that antagonist occupation of one of the two ligand binding sites is unable to prevent agonist-mediated internalization. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Oligomerization of the G protein-coupled cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor has been demonstrated, but its molecular basis and functional importance are not clear. We now examine contributions of transmembrane (TM) segments to oligomerization of this receptor using a peptide competitive inhibition strategy. Oligomerization of CCK receptors tagged at the carboxyl terminus with Renilla luciferase or yellow fluorescent protein was quantified using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). Synthetic peptides representing TM I, II, V, VI, and VII of the CCK receptor were utilized as competitors. Of these, only TM VI and VII peptides disrupted receptor BRET. Control studies established that the beta2-adrenergic receptor TM VI peptide that disrupts oligomerization of that receptor had no effect on CCK receptor BRET. Notably, disruption of CCK receptor oligomerization had no effect on agonist binding, biological activity, or receptor internalization. To gain insight into the face of TM VI contributing to oligomerization, we utilized analogous peptides with alanines in positions 315, 319, and 323 (interhelical face) or 317, 321, and 325 (external lipid-exposed face). The Ala317,321,325 peptide eliminated the disruptive effect on CCK receptor BRET, whereas the other mutant peptide behaved like wild-type TM VI. This suggests that the lipid-exposed face of the CCK receptor TM VI most contributes to oligomerization and supports external contact dimerization of helical bundles, rather than domain-swapped dimerization. Fluorescent CCK receptor mutants with residues 317, 321, and 325 replaced with alanines were also prepared and failed to yield significant resonance transfer signals using either BRET or a morphological FRET assay, further supporting this interpretation.},

abstract = {Hormones, sensory stimuli, neurotransmitters and chemokines signal by activating G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) [1]. Although GPCRs are thought to function as monomers, they can form SDS-resistant dimers, and coexpression of two non-functional or related GPCRs can result in rescue of activity or modification of function [2-10]. Furthermore, dimerization of peptides corresponding to the third cytoplasmic loops of GPCRs increases their potency as activators of G proteins in vitro [11], and peptide inhibitors of dimerization diminish beta(2)-adrenergic receptor signaling [3]. Nevertheless, it is not known whether GPCRs exist as monomers or oligomers in intact cells and membranes, whether agonist binding regulates monomer-oligomer equilibrium, or whether oligomerization governs GPCR function. Here, we report that the alpha-factor receptor, a GPCR that is the product of the STE2 gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is oligomeric in intact cells and membranes. Coexpression of receptors tagged with the cyan or yellow fluorescent proteins (CFP or YFP) resulted in efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) due to stable association rather than collisional interaction. Monomer-oligomer equilibrium was unaffected by binding of agonist, antagonist, or G protein heterotrimers. Oligomerization was further demonstrated by rescuing endocytosis-defective receptors with coexpressed wild-type receptors. Dominant-interfering receptor mutants inhibited signaling by interacting with wild-type receptors rather than by sequestering G protein heterotrimers. We suggest that oligomerization is likely to govern GPCR signaling and regulation.},

abstract = {The issue of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) oligomer status has not been resolved. Although many studies have provided evidence in favor of receptor-receptor interactions, there is no consensus as to the exact oligomer size of class A GPCRs. Previous studies have reported monomers, dimers, tetramers, and higher-order oligomers. In the present study, this issue was examined using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) with photon counting histogram (PCH) analysis, a sensitive method for monitoring diffusion and oligomer size of plasma membrane proteins. Six different class A GPCRs were selected from the serotonin (5-HT2A), adrenergic ($\alpha$1b-AR and $\beta$2-AR), muscarinic (M1 and M2), and dopamine (D1) receptor families. Each GPCR was C-terminally labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) or yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. FCS provided plasma membrane diffusion coefficients on the order of 7.5 × 10(-9) cm(2)/s. PCH molecular brightness analysis was used to determine the GPCR oligomer size. Known monomeric (CD-86) and dimeric (CD-28) receptors with GFP and YFP tags were used as controls to determine the molecular brightness of monomers and dimers. PCH analysis of fluorescence-tagged GPCRs revealed molecular brightness values that were twice the monomeric controls and similar to the dimeric controls. Reduced $\chi$(2) analyses of the PCH data best fit a model for a homogeneous population of homodimers, without tetramers or higher-order oligomers. The homodimer configuration was unaltered by agonist treatment and was stable over a 10-fold range of receptor expression level. The results of this study demonstrate that biogenic amine receptors freely diffusing within the plasma membrane are predominantly homodimers.},

abstract = {Adrenergic drugs acting through the beta(2)-adrenoceptor (beta(2)-AR) adenylate cyclase (AC) signal transduction system elicit a variety of responses within the mammalian airway epithelium; however, its composition of multiple phenotypically differentiated cell types complicates the understanding of the regulation cascades within this tissue. The present study evaluates beta(2)-AR mRNA level, number, subtype and the cyclic adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) response to isoproterenol (iso) in the human airway epithelial cell lines 16HBE14o(-), Calu-3 and A549, using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), radioligand binding studies, [(3)H]-radioimmunoassay and immunocytochemical staining. After 4-5 days in culture, all three cell types produced beta(2)-AR mRNA and protein at a magnitude of gene expression levels Calu-3>or=16HBE14o(-)>A549, whereas control cells Cos-1 and Caco-2 were negative. The beta(2)-AR adenylate cyclase system was highly expressed and functional in the human airway epithelial cells Calu-3 and 16HBE14o(-). The mean beta(2)-AR density (B(max)), equilibrium dissociation constant (K(D)), and the percentage of beta-AR subtypes assessed by radioligand binding were approximately 9908+/-1127 and 6423+/-895 binding sites/cell, 32+/-2.7 pM and 25+/-1.1 pM, and approximately 100{\%} in Calu-3 and 16HBE14o(-)cells, respectively. However, in the alveolar cell type A549 the cell surface beta(2)-AR was virtually undetectable by (-)-[(125)I]-iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) binding. Stimulation of cultured cells with (-)-isoproterenol enhanced the basal cyclic AMP accumulation only in Calu-3 and 16HBE14o(-) cells, which was blocked by the beta(2)-selective antagonist ICI 118,551, but not by the beta(1)-selective antagonist CGP 20712A, confirming functional coupling of the beta(2)-AR to adenylate cyclase in these cells. Immunocytochemical staining localised the receptor on the cell membrane and the cytoplasm in Calu-3 and 16HBE14o(-) cells, while it was confined to the cytoplasm only in A549 cells. In conclusion, the beta(2)-AR expression and its functional coupling to adenylyl cyclase was very high in the human airway epithelial cells Calu-3 and 16HBE14o(-), but not in A549, suggesting that the cell lines Calu-3 and 16HBE14o(-) present suitable models to study function and regulation of the beta-adrenoceptor signalling in the respiratory system.},

abstract = {Multiple and paradoxical effects of airway smooth muscle (ASM) 7-transmembrane-spanning receptors activated during asthma, or by treatment with bronchodilators such as beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR) agonists, indicate extensive receptor crosstalk. We examined the signaling of the prostanoid-EP(1) receptor, since its endogenous agonist prostaglandin E(2) is abundant in the airway, but its functional implications are poorly defined. Activation of EP(1) failed to elicit ASM contraction in mouse trachea via this G(alphaq)-coupled receptor. However, EP(1) activation markedly reduced the bronchodilatory function of beta(2)AR agonist, but not forskolin, indicating an early pathway interaction. Activation of EP(1) reduced beta(2)AR-stimulated cAMP in ASM but did not promote or augment beta(2)AR phosphorylation or alter beta(2)AR trafficking. Bioluminescence resonant energy transfer showed EP(1) and beta(2)AR formed heterodimers, which were further modified by EP(1) agonist. In cell membrane [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding studies, the presence of the EP(1) component of the dimer uncoupled beta(2)AR from G(alphas), an effect accentuated by EP(1) agonist activation. Thus alone, EP(1) does not appear to have a significant direct effect on airway tone but acts as a modulator of the beta(2)AR, altering G(alphas) coupling via steric interactions imposed by the EP(1):beta(2)AR heterodimeric signaling complex and ultimately affecting beta(2)AR-mediated bronchial relaxation. This mechanism may contribute to beta-agonist resistance found in asthma.},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors are one of the most actively studied families of proteins. However, despite the ubiquity of protein dimerization and oligomerization as a structural and functional motif in biology, until the last decade they were generally considered as monomeric, non-interacting polypeptides. For the metabotropic glutamate-like group of G protein-coupled receptors, it is now firmly established that they exist and function as dimers or, potentially, even within higher-order structures. Despite some evidence continuing to support the view that rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptors are predominantly monomers, many recent studies are consistent with the dimerization/oligomerization of such receptors. Key roles suggested for dimerization of G protein-coupled receptors include control of protein maturation and cell surface delivery and providing the correct framework for interactions with both hetero-trimeric G proteins and arrestins to allow signal generation and its termination. As G protein-coupled receptors are the most targeted group of proteins for the development of therapeutic small molecule medicines, recent indications that hetero-dimerization between co-expressed G protein-coupled receptors may be a common process offers the potential for the development of more selective and tissue restricted medicines. However, many of the key experiments have, so far, been limited to model cell systems. Priorities for the future include the generation of tools and reagents able to identify unequivocally potential G protein-coupled receptor hetero-dimers in native tissues and detailed analyses of the influence of hetero-dimerization on receptor function and pharmacology.},

abstract = {The critical involvement of GPCRs (G-protein-coupled receptors) in nearly all physiological processes, and the presence of these receptors at the interface between the extracellular and the intracellular milieu, has positioned these receptors as pivotal therapeutic targets. Although a large number of drugs targeting GPCRs are currently available, significant efforts have been directed towards understanding receptor properties, with the goal of identifying and designing improved receptor ligands. Recent advances in GPCR pharmacology have demonstrated that different ligands binding to the same receptor can activate discrete sets of downstream effectors, a phenomenon known as 'ligand-directed signal specificity', which is currently being explored for drug development due to its potential therapeutic advantage. Emerging studies suggest that GPCR responses can also be modulated by contextual factors, such as interactions with other GPCRs. Association between different GPCR types leads to the formation of complexes, or GPCR heteromers, with distinct and unique signalling properties. Some of these heteromers activate discrete sets of signalling effectors upon activation by the same ligand, a phenomenon termed 'heteromer-directed signalling specificity'. This has been shown to be involved in the physiological role of receptors and, in some cases, in disease-specific dysregulation of a receptor effect. Hence targeting GPCR heteromers constitutes an emerging strategy to select receptor-specific responses and is likely to be useful in achieving specific beneficial therapeutic effects.},

It has largely been assumed that receptor mutants do not affect the function of the wild-type receptor; however, the occurrence of G protein-coupled receptor dimerization suggests the possibility that an intermolecular interaction between mutant and wild-type receptors can occur. We have shown previously that the D2 dopamine receptor (D2DR) exists as dimers in cell lines and brain tissue. In this study, we demonstrated that mutant D2DR can modulate the function of the wild-type D2DR. While attempting to elucidate the structure of the D2DR dimer, we demonstrated that nonfunctional D2DR substitution and truncation mutants antagonized wild-type D2DR function. Furthermore, from analyses of this interaction between the receptor mutants and the D2DR, using photoaffinity labeling, we provide evidence that the D2DR is oligomeric in the cell.},

Mast cells were obtained by lavage of the pleural and peritoneal cavities of Sprague-Dawley rats and were purified on metrizamide gradients to greater than 95{\%} purity. Resting mast cells stimulated with beta-adrenergic agonists demonstrate a marked rise in cAMP levels after a 15-sec incubation. However, the same concentrations of these agonists have no effect on IgE-mediated mast cell histamine release. [3H]DHA binding to intact mast cells is rapid, reversible, saturable, and stereoselective. The cells possess 40,000 +/- 14,000 beta-adrenergic receptors/cell and demonstrate a binding affinity of 1.58 +/- 0.56 nM for [3H]DHA. Competition studies reveal that 83.5{\%} of the receptors are of the beta 2 subtype and 16.5{\%} are beta 1. Neither sensitization with anti-DNP-BSA IgE nor subsequent challenge with specific antigen alters mast cell beta-adrenergic receptor characteristics. Rat mast cells possesses large numbers of high affinity beta-adrenergic receptors, primarily of the beta 2 subtype, coupled to adenylate cyclase, but the role of these receptors in mast cell secretory events is not yet established.},

Recent findings have indicated not only that many GPCRs exist as homodimers and heterodimers, but also that their oligomeric assembly could have important functional roles. Several studies have shown that dimerization occurs early after biosynthesis, suggesting that it has a primary role in receptor maturation. G-protein coupling, downstream signalling and regulatory processes such as internalization have also been shown to be influenced by the dimeric nature of the receptors. In addition to raising fundamental questions about GPCR function, the concept of dimerization could be important in the development and screening of drugs that act through this receptor class. In particular, the changes in ligand-binding and signalling properties that accompany heterodimerization could give rise to an unexpected pharmacological diversity that would need to be considered.},

abstract = {Recently, several studies have reported oligomerization of G protein-coupled receptors, although the functional implications of this phenomenon are still unclear. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and coimmunoprecipitation (COIP), we previously reported that the human thyrotropin (TSH) receptor tagged with green fluorescent protein (TSHR(GFP)) and expressed in a heterologous system was present as oligomeric complexes on the cell surface. Here, we have extended this biophysical and biochemical approach to study the regulation of such oligomeric complexes. Co-expression of TSHR(GFP) and TSHR(Myc) constructs in Chinese hamster ovary cells resulted in FRET-positive cells. The specificity of the FRET signal was verified by the absence of energy transfer in individually transfected TSHR(GFP) and TSHR(Myc):Cy3 cells cultured together and also by acceptor photobleaching. Occupation of the receptor molecule by the ligand (TSH) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the FRET index from 20{\%} in the absence of TSH to <1{\%} with 10(3) microunits/ml of TSH. Such reduction in oligomeric forms was also confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation. Exposure of TSHR(GFP/Myc) cells to forskolin or cytochalasin D caused no change in the FRET index, confirming that the decrease in the oligomeric complexes was a receptor-dependent phenomenon and free of energy or microtuble requirements. The TSH-induced decrease in TSHR oligomers was found to be secondary to dissociation of the TSHR complexes as evidenced by an increase in fluorescent intensity of photobleached spots of GFP fluorescence with 10(3) microunits/ml of TSH. These data indicated that the less active conformation of the TSHR was comprised of receptor complexes and that such complexes were dissociated on the binding of ligand. Such observations support the concept of a constitutively active TSHR dimer or monomer that is naturally inhibited by the formation of higher order complexes. Inhibition of these oligomeric forms by ligand binding returns the TSHR to an activated state.},

At that time, the concept of cell surface receptors was relatively new and not widely accepted, and most of the tools currently used to characterize plasma membrane receptors had not been developed. There has been remarkable progress in receptor biology since then, including the development of radioligand binding assays, the biochemical characterization of receptors as discrete membrane proteins, and the cloning of the first G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which led to the identification of other members of the large family of GPCRs. More recently, progress in GPCR structural biology has led to insights into the three-dimensional structures of ??ARs in both active and inactive states.

abstract = {The beta(2)-adrenoceptor (beta(2)AR) was one of the first Family A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) shown to form oligomers in cellular membranes, yet we still know little about the number and arrangement of protomers in oligomers, the influence of ligands on the organization or stability of oligomers, or the requirement for other proteins to promote oligomerization. We used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to characterize the oligomerization of purified beta(2)AR site-specifically labelled at three different positions with fluorophores and reconstituted into a model lipid bilayer. Our results suggest that the beta(2)AR is predominantly tetrameric following reconstitution into phospholipid vesicles. Agonists and antagonists have little effect on the relative orientation of protomers in oligomeric complexes. In contrast, binding of inverse agonists leads to significant increases in FRET efficiencies for most labelling pairs, suggesting that this class of ligand promotes tighter packing of protomers and/or the formation of more complex oligomers by reducing conformational fluctuations in individual protomers. The results provide new structural insights into beta(2)AR oligomerization and suggest a possible mechanism for the functional effects of inverse agonists.},

abstract = {Up to now, transgenic mice models created to study the physiological impact of alterations in the human beta-adrenoceptor system have only focused on cardiac tissues and carried hybrid transgenes with strong cardiac promoters. We have developed a transgenic mouse strain (F28) carrying the human beta 2-adrenoceptor gene with its natural promoter region with the aim of producing a model that more closely reproduces the natural human beta 2-adrenoceptor tissue expression pattern. By means of northern blot analyses, using the appropriate probes, we have obtained evidence that (a) the human beta 2-adrenoceptor's structural gene is transcribed in several tissues of F28 mice; (b) the tissue distribution pattern of human beta 2-adrenoceptor mRNA in F28 mice completely differs from that of mouse beta 2-adrenoceptor mRNA; and (c) the tissue distribution pattern of mouse beta 2-adrenoceptor mRNA in F28 mice is very similar to that observed in their non-transgenic littermates. Like humans, F28 mice express human beta 2-adrenoceptor mRNA in liver, lung, brain, heart, and muscle. However, unlike humans, F28 mice do not accumulate human beta 2-adrenoceptor mRNA in kidney and spleen. By using [125I]iodocyanopindolol to label all beta-adrenoceptors and ICI 118,551 to discriminate between the binding to beta 2- and beta 1-adrenoceptors we have demonstrated that the beta 2-adrenoceptor binding activity increases over control values in F28 mouse tissues that accumulate transgenic mRNA. Accordingly, the number of beta 2-adrenoceptors increased slightly over the control values in muscle, heart, brain, and lung of F28 mice, while in liver these receptors were strongly overexpressed. We further showed that transgene beta 2-adrenoceptors couple to GTP-binding proteins, mediate beta-adrenoceptor agonist-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activation, and cause a strong enhancement of this response in liver membranes of F28 versus control mice. Finally, F28 mice show a phenotype of depressed ponderal development and perturbed hindquarter movements. This unique model should be useful to further investigate beta 2-adrenoceptor causal relationships with human pathologies.},

abstract = {F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) with fluorescent proteins permits high spatial resolution imaging of protein-protein interactions in living cells. However, substantial non-FRET fluorescence background can obscure small FRET signals, making many potential interactions unobservable by conventional FRET techniques. Here we demonstrate time-resolved microscopy of luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) for live-cell imaging of protein-protein interactions. A luminescent terbium complex, TMP-Lumi4, was introduced into cultured cells using two methods: (i) osmotic lysis of pinocytic vesicles; and (ii) reversible membrane permeabilization with streptolysin O. Upon intracellular delivery, the complex was observed to bind specifically and stably to transgenically expressed Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR) fusion proteins. LRET between the eDHFR-bound terbium complex and green fluorescent protein (GFP) was detected as long-lifetime, sensitized GFP emission. Background signals from cellular autofluorescence and directly excited GFP fluorescence were effectively eliminated by imposing a time delay (10 micros) between excitation and detection. Background elimination made it possible to detect interactions between the first PDZ domain of ZO-1 (fused to eDHFR) and the C-terminal YV motif of claudin-1 (fused to GFP) in single microscope images at subsecond time scales. We observed a highly significant (P<10(-6)), six-fold difference between the mean, donor-normalized LRET signal from cells expressing interacting fusion proteins and from control cells expressing noninteracting mutants. The results show that time-resolved LRET microscopy with a selectively targeted, luminescent terbium protein label affords improved speed and sensitivity over conventional FRET methods for a variety of live-cell imaging and screening applications.},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent one of the largest families of cell surface receptors, and are the target of more than half of the current therapeutic drugs on the market. When activated by an agonist, the GPCR undergoes conformational changes that facilitate its interaction with heterotrimeric G proteins, which then relay signals to downstream intracellular effectors. Although GPCRs were thought to function as monomers, many studies support the hypothesis that G protein coupling involves the formation of GPCR homo- and/or hetero-complexes. These complex systems have been suggested to exhibit specific signaling cascades, pharmacological, internalization, and recycling properties. In this review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the structure, function and dynamics of GPCR complexes, as well as the findings obtained in animal models.},

abstract = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest family of receptors and major pharmacological targets. Whereas many GPCRs have been shown to form di-/oligomers, the size and stability of such complexes under physiological conditions are largely unknown. Here, we used direct receptor labeling with SNAP-tags and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to dynamically monitor single receptors on intact cells and thus compare the spatial arrangement, mobility, and supramolecular organization of three prototypical GPCRs: the $\beta$(1)-adrenergic receptor ($\beta$(1)AR), the $\beta$(2)-adrenergic receptor ($\beta$(2)AR), and the $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA(B)) receptor. These GPCRs showed very different degrees of di-/oligomerization, lowest for $\beta$(1)ARs (monomers/dimers) and highest for GABA(B) receptors (prevalently dimers/tetramers of heterodimers). The size of receptor complexes increased with receptor density as a result of transient receptor-receptor interactions. Whereas $\beta$(1)-/$\beta$(2)ARs were apparently freely diffusing on the cell surface, GABA(B) receptors were prevalently organized into ordered arrays, via interaction with the actin cytoskeleton. Agonist stimulation did not alter receptor di-/oligomerization, but increased the mobility of GABA(B) receptor complexes. These data provide a spatiotemporal characterization of $\beta$(1)-/$\beta$(2)ARs and GABA(B) receptors at single-molecule resolution. The results suggest that GPCRs are present on the cell surface in a dynamic equilibrium, with constant formation and dissociation of new receptor complexes that can be targeted, in a ligand-regulated manner, to different cell-surface microdomains.},

In this review we will briefly summarize the main features of $\beta$arrestin binding to the adrenergic receptor subtypes and we will review more in detail the main proteins found to selectively interact with distinct AR subtype.

abstract = {In its native form, the chemokine CX3CL1 is a firmly adhesive molecule promoting leukocyte adhesion and migration and hence involved, along with its unique receptor CX3CR1, in various inflammatory processes. Here we investigated the role of molecular aggregation in the CX3CL1 adhesiveness. Assays of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) and homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) in transfected cell lines and in primary cells showed specific signals indicative of CX3CL1 clustering. Truncation experiments showed that the transmembrane domain played a central role in this aggregation. A chimera with mutations of the 12 central transmembrane domain residues had significantly reduced BRET signals and characteristics of a non-clustering molecule. This mutant was weakly adhesive according to flow and dual pipette adhesion assays and was less glycosylated than CX3CL1, although, as we demonstrated, loss of glycosylation did not affect the CX3CL1 adhesive potency. We postulate that cell surfaces express CX3CL1 as a constitutive oligomer and that this oligomerization is essential for its adhesive potency. Inhibition of CX3CL1 self-assembly could limit the recruitment of CX3CR1-positive cells and may be a new pathway for anti-inflammatory therapies.},

abstract = {Site-directed mutagenesis guided by evolutionary trace analysis revealed that substitution of V179 and W183 within a cluster of evolutionarily important residues on the surface of the fourth transmembrane domain of the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (beta(1)AR) significantly reduced the propensity of the receptor to self-assemble into homodimers as assessed by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer in living cells. These results suggest that mutation of V179 and W183 result in conformational changes that reduce homodimerization either directly by interfering with the dimerization interface or indirectly by causing local misfolding that result in reduced self-assembly. However, the mutations did not cause a general misfolding of the beta(1)AR as they did not prevent heterodimerization with the beta(2)AR. The homodimerization-compromised mutants were significantly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and could not be properly matured and trafficked to the cell surface. Lipophilic beta-adrenergic ligands acted as pharmacological chaperones by restoring both dimerization and plasma membrane trafficking of the ER-retained dimerization-compromised beta(1)AR mutants. These results clearly indicate that homodimerization occurs early in the biosynthetic process in the ER and that pharmacological chaperones can promote both dimerization and cell surface targeting, most likely by stabilizing receptor conformations compatible with the two processes.},

The model takes into account possible pathways for transfer of optical excitations from single donors to multiple acceptors and from multiple donors (non-simultaneously) to single acceptors. This necessary departure from the standard theory has been suggested in the literature, but it has only been successfully implemented for a few particular cases, such as for particular geometries of the oligomers. The predictions of the present theoretical model differ significantly from those of the standard theory, with the exception of the case of dimers, for which agreement is observed. This model therefore provides new insights into the FRET behavior of oligomers comprising more than two monomers, and also suggests means for determining the size of oligomeric protein complexes as well as the proportion of associated and unassociated monomers.},

Recent advances in GPCR crystallography have provided inactive and active state structures for rhodopsin and the ??2 adrenergic receptor (??2AR). Although these structures suggest a two-state 'on-off' mechanism of receptor activation, other biophysical studies and observed signaling versatility suggest that GPCRs are highly dynamic and exist in a multitude of functionally distinct conformations. To fully understand how GPCRs work, we must characterize these conformations and determine how ligands affect their energetics and rates of interconversion.

Based on this concept, we have tested the hypothesis that truncated GPCRs can act as negative regulators of wild-type receptor function. Using the GS-coupled V2 vasopressin receptor as a model system, we systematically analyzed the ability of N- and C-terminal V2 receptor fragments to interfere with the activity of the wild-type V2 receptor coexpressed in COS-7 cells. Several N-terminal V2 receptor truncation mutants were identified that strongly inhibited the function (as determined in cAMP and radioligand binding assays) and cell surface trafficking of the coexpressed full-length V2 receptor. However, these truncation mutants did not interfere with the function of other GS-coupled receptors such as the D1 dopamine and the beta2-adrenergic receptors. Dominant negative effects were only observed with mutant receptors that contained at least three transmembrane domains. In addition, immunoblotting experiments showed that all V2 receptor truncation mutants displaying dominant negative activity (but not those mutant receptors lacking this activity) were able to form heterodimers with the full-length V2 receptor, suggesting that complex formation between mutant and wild-type V2 receptors underlies the observed inhibition of wild-type receptor function. Given the high degree of structural homology shared by all GPCRs, our findings should also be applicable to other members of this receptor superfamily.},

abstract = {The beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) is a well-studied prototype for heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that respond to diffusible hormones and neurotransmitters. To overcome the structural flexibility of the beta2AR and to facilitate its crystallization, we engineered a beta2AR fusion protein in which T4 lysozyme (T4L) replaces most of the third intracellular loop of the GPCR ("beta2AR-T4L") and showed that this protein retains near-native pharmacologic properties. Analysis of adrenergic receptor ligand-binding mutants within the context of the reported high-resolution structure of beta2AR-T4L provides insights into inverse-agonist binding and the structural changes required to accommodate catecholamine agonists. Amino acids known to regulate receptor function are linked through packing interactions and a network of hydrogen bonds, suggesting a conformational pathway from the ligand-binding pocket to regions that interact with G proteins.},

One focus of asthma pharmacogenetic research has been the beta2-adrenergic receptor gene (ADR beta 2) and its effect on individual responses to beta agonist therapy. Knowledge about the effects of ADR beta 2 variation on therapeutic responses is evolving and should not alter current Asthma Guideline approaches, which consist of the use of short-acting beta agonists (SABAs) for as-needed symptom-based therapy and the use of a regular long-acting beta agonist (LABA) in combination with inhaled corticosteroid therapy for those asthmatics whose symptoms are not controlled by inhaled corticosteroid alone. These approaches are based upon studies showing a consistent pharmacogenetic response to regular use of SABAs and less consistent findings in studies evaluating LABAs. The emerging pharmacogenetic studies are provocative and should lead to functional studies. Meanwhile, the conflicting data concerning LABAs may be caused by such factors as small sample sizes of study populations and differences in experimental design.},

abstract = {Site-directed mutagenesis guided by evolutionary trace analysis revealed that substitution of V179 and W183 within a cluster of evolutionarily important residues on the surface of the fourth transmembrane domain of the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (beta(1)AR) significantly reduced the propensity of the receptor to self-assemble into homodimers as assessed by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer in living cells. These results suggest that mutation of V179 and W183 result in conformational changes that reduce homodimerization either directly by interfering with the dimerization interface or indirectly by causing local misfolding that result in reduced self-assembly. However, the mutations did not cause a general misfolding of the beta(1)AR as they did not prevent heterodimerization with the beta(2)AR. The homodimerization-compromised mutants were significantly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and could not be properly matured and trafficked to the cell surface. Lipophilic beta-adrenergic ligands acted as pharmacological chaperones by restoring both dimerization and plasma membrane trafficking of the ER-retained dimerization-compromised beta(1)AR mutants. These results clearly indicate that homodimerization occurs early in the biosynthetic process in the ER and that pharmacological chaperones can promote both dimerization and cell surface targeting, most likely by stabilizing receptor conformations compatible with the two processes.},

abstract = {Multiple and paradoxical effects of airway smooth muscle (ASM) 7-transmembrane-spanning receptors activated during asthma, or by treatment with bronchodilators such as beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR) agonists, indicate extensive receptor crosstalk. We examined the signaling of the prostanoid-EP(1) receptor, since its endogenous agonist prostaglandin E(2) is abundant in the airway, but its functional implications are poorly defined. Activation of EP(1) failed to elicit ASM contraction in mouse trachea via this G(alphaq)-coupled receptor. However, EP(1) activation markedly reduced the bronchodilatory function of beta(2)AR agonist, but not forskolin, indicating an early pathway interaction. Activation of EP(1) reduced beta(2)AR-stimulated cAMP in ASM but did not promote or augment beta(2)AR phosphorylation or alter beta(2)AR trafficking. Bioluminescence resonant energy transfer showed EP(1) and beta(2)AR formed heterodimers, which were further modified by EP(1) agonist. In cell membrane [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding studies, the presence of the EP(1) component of the dimer uncoupled beta(2)AR from G(alphas), an effect accentuated by EP(1) agonist activation. Thus alone, EP(1) does not appear to have a significant direct effect on airway tone but acts as a modulator of the beta(2)AR, altering G(alphas) coupling via steric interactions imposed by the EP(1):beta(2)AR heterodimeric signaling complex and ultimately affecting beta(2)AR-mediated bronchial relaxation. This mechanism may contribute to beta-agonist resistance found in asthma.},

abstract = {We extend the technique of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) by introducing a luminescent terbium chelate as a donor and an organic dye, tetramethylrhodamine, as an acceptor. The results are consistent with a F{\"{o}}rster theory of energy transfer, provided the appropriate parameters are used. The use of lanthanide donors, in general, and this pair, in particular, has many advantages over more conventional FRET pairs, which rely solely on organic dyes. The distance at which 50{\%} energy transfer occurs is large, 65 A; the donor lifetime is a single exponential and long (millisecond), making lifetime measurements facile and accurate. Uncertainty in the orientation factor, which creates uncertainty in measured distances, is minimized by the donor's multiple electronic transitions and long lifetime. The sensitized emission of the acceptor can be measured with little or no interfering background, yielding a > 25-fold improvements in the signal-to-background ratio over standard donor-acceptor pairs. These improvements are expected to make distances > 100 A measurable via FRET. We also report measurement of the sensitized emission lifetime, a measurement that is completely insensitive to total concentration and incomplete labeling.},

The structure provides a high-resolution view of a human G protein-coupled receptor bound to a diffusible ligand. Ligand-binding site accessibility is enabled by the second extracellular loop, which is held out of the binding cavity by a pair of closely spaced disulfide bridges and a short helical segment within the loop. Cholesterol, a necessary component for crystallization, mediates an intriguing parallel association of receptor molecules in the crystal lattice. Although the location of carazolol in the beta2-adrenergic receptor is very similar to that of retinal in rhodopsin, structural differences in the ligand-binding site and other regions highlight the challenges in using rhodopsin as a template model for this large receptor family.},

abstract = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can form heteromeric complexes. Herein, we describe a new approach to test the heteromerization of 2 receptors, or 2 receptor subunits, and to study the stoichiometry of the resulting complexes. As a proof-of-concept study, we investigated whether metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), in addition to being well-known homodimers, can form heteromers. To that aim, we combine the benefits of time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (trFRET) with the specific, cell-surface labeling of SNAP- and CLIP-tagged rat mGluR subunits, expressed in a mammalian cell line. First, we show that mGlu2 and mGlu4 subunits (but not mGlu2 and mGlu1) can heteromerize. Moreover, our trFRET data are consistent with mGluR subunits forming strict homodimeric receptors on single expression, and a combination of strict heterodimeric and strict homodimeric receptors on coexpression. Second, a comprehensive analysis reveals that from the 21 possible pairs of 2 mGluR subunits out of 7 subtypes (mGlu1 to 8, but not 6), only 11 are able to form heterodimers. These findings were further validated by biochemical and functional complementation studies. In addition to describing a new method to analyze cell-surface receptor complexes, our data reveal a new level of complexity within the mGluR family.},

These A2A/D2 heteromeric receptor complexes undergo coaggregation, cointernalization, and codesensitization on D2 or A2A receptor agonist treatments and especially after combined agonist treatment. It is hypothesized that the A2A/D2 receptor heteromer represents the molecular basis for the antagonistic A2A/D2 receptor interactions demonstrated at the biochemical and behavioral levels. Functional heteromeric complexes between A2A and metabotropic glutamate 5 receptors (mGluR5) have also recently been demonstrated in HEK-293 cells and rat striatal membrane preparations. The A2A/mGluR5 receptor heteromer may account for the synergism found after combined agonist treatments demonstrated in different in vitro and in vivo models. D2, A2A, and mGluR5 receptors are found together in the dendritic spines of the striatopallidal GABA neurons. Therefore, possible D2/A2A/mGluR5 multimeric receptor complexes and the receptor interactions within them may have a major role in controlling the dorsal and ventral striatopallidal GABA neurons involved in Parkinson's disease and in schizophrenia and drug addiction, respectively.},

I-CYP binding was saturable (maximum binding capacity Bmax = 51 +/- 3 fmol mg-1 protein), involving sites with high affinity (dissociation constant KD = 73 +/- 10 pM). Specific I-CYP binding was displaceable both by beta-adrenoceptor agonists ((-)-isoprenaline greater than (-)-adrenaline greater than (+/-)-fenoterol greater than (-)-noradrenaline greater than (+)-isoprenaline greater than (+/-)-RO363) and antagonists ((+/-)-propranolol greater than ICI-118551 greater than atenolol), indicating a predominance of beta 2-adrenoceptors. Further analysis showed that displacement data for the beta 1-selective antagonist atenolol and the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI-118551 were fitted best to a 2 binding site model and that both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors were present in pig lung in the ratio 28:72 respectively. Autoradiographic grains were localized over tissue and were most dense over alveolar walls greater than vascular endothelium greater than vascular smooth muscle greater than bronchial smooth muscle = bronchial epithelium. Atenolol (10(-5) M) caused a 31{\%} reduction in specific grain density over alveolar wall tissue, while a 10 fold lower concentration of ICI-118551 (10(-6) M) caused a 50{\%} decrease. These results are consistent with binding data in pig lung parenchyma demonstrating a mixed population of beta-adrenoceptors with a predominance of the beta 2 subtype. 6 It is possible that the previously described relaxant responses of the pig lung parenchyma strip to beta-agonists, mediated via beta 2-adrenoceptors, resulted from the sum of reactivities in airway and vascular smooth muscle together with relaxation of alveolar interstitial cells.},

abstract = {Cell-surface proteins are important in cell-cell communication. They assemble into heterocomplexes that include different receptors and effectors. Elucidation and manipulation of such protein complexes offers new therapeutic possibilities. We describe a methodology combining time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) with snap-tag technology to quantitatively analyze protein-protein interactions at the surface of living cells, in a high throughput-compatible format. Using this approach, we examined whether G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are monomers or assemble into dimers or larger oligomers--a matter of intense debate. We obtained evidence for the oligomeric state of both class A and class C GPCRs. We also observed different quaternary structure of GPCRs for the neurotransmitters glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA): whereas metabotropic glutamate receptors assembled into strict dimers, the GABA(B) receptors spontaneously formed dimers of heterodimers, offering a way to modulate G-protein coupling efficacy. This approach will be useful in systematic analysis of cell-surface protein interaction in living cells.},

abstract = {Although homo-oligomerization has been reported for several G protein-coupled receptors, this phenomenon was not studied at low concentrations of receptors. Furthermore, it is not clear whether homo-oligomerization corresponds to an intrinsic property of nascent receptors or if it is a consequence of receptor activation. Here CCR5 receptor oligomerization was studied by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) in cells expressing physiological levels of receptors. A strong energy transfer could be observed, in the absence of ligands, in whole cells and in both endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane subfractions, supporting the hypothesis of a constitutive oligomerization that occurs early after biosynthesis. No change in BRET was observed upon agonist binding, indicating that the extent of oligomerization is unrelated to the activation state of the receptor. In contrast, a robust increase of BRET, induced by a monoclonal antibody known to promote receptor clustering, suggests that microaggregation of preformed receptor homo-oligomers can occur. Taken together, our data indicate that constitutive receptor homo-oligomerization has a biologically relevant significance and might be involved in the process of receptor biosynthesis.},

abstract = {Dimerization and phosphorylation of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptors was characterized using HEK293 and pituitary GHFT cells expressing epitope-tagged receptors. TRH receptors tagged with FLAG and hemagglutinin epitopes were co-precipitated only if they were co-expressed, and 10-30{\%} of receptors were isolated as hemagglutinin/FLAG-receptor dimers under basal conditions. The abundance of receptor dimers was increased when cells had been stimulated by TRH, indicating that TRH either stabilizes pre-existing dimers or increases dimer formation. TRH increased receptor dimerization and phosphorylation within 1 min in a dose-dependent manner. TRH increased phosphorylation of both receptor monomers and dimers, documented by incorporation of (32)P and an upshift in receptor mobility reversed by phosphatase treatment. The ability of TRH to increase receptor phosphorylation and dimerization did not depend on signal transduction, because it was not inhibited by the phospholipase C inhibitor. Receptor phosphorylation required an agonist but was not blocked by the casein kinase II inhibitor apigenin, the protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X, or expression of a dominant negative form of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2. TRH receptors lacking most of the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus formed dimers constitutively but failed to undergo agonist-induced dimerization and phosphorylation. TRH also increased phosphorylation and dimerization of TRH receptors expressed in GHFT pre-lactotroph cells.},

The results of [3H]formoterol saturation binding and formoterol inhibition of [3H]formoterol binding were consistent with binding to a single class of receptors (Kd = 1.34 +/- 0.15 nM, Bmax = 154.9 +/- 8.0 fmol/mg protein in guinea pig lung membranes, n = 8; Kd = 1.05 +/- 0.17 nM, Bmax = 67.8 +/- 8.1 fmol/mg protein in human lung membranes, n = 5) and competition assays with other agonists and antagonists disclosed only a single class of site. The nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue GTP gamma S caused a reduction in both Kd and Bmax, indicating that the receptors labelled by [3H]formoterol are coupled to a guanine nucleotide binding regulatory protein. Receptor mapping of [3H]formoterol binding sites shows that beta 2-adrenoceptors were widely distributed in both guinea pig and human lung, with dense labelling over airway epithelium and uniformly over alveolar walls, and sparse labelling of airway and vascular smooth muscle. In addition, submucosal glands were also sparsely labelled in human bronchus. The distribution of beta 2-adrenoceptors was similar to the pattern previously described with non-selective radiolabelled antagonists in the presence of selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonists.},

Myristoylation was studied as a means to introduce peptides into living cells. Uptake of a myristoylated, fluorescent peptide was efficient in the B lymphocyte cell line BA/F3. In contrast, this cell line was resistant to uptake of a cell-penetrating peptide derived from the TAT protein. In BA/F3 cells, membrane association was shown to be rapid, reaching a maximum within 30 min. Cellular uptake of the peptide lagged the membrane association but occurred within a similar time frame. Experiments performed at 37 versus 4 degrees C demonstrated profound temperature dependence in the cellular uptake of myristoylated cargo. Myristoylated peptides with either positive or negative charge were shown to load efficiently. In contrast to TAT-conjugated cargo, pyrenebutyrate did not enhance cellular uptake of the myristoylated peptide. The myristoylated peptide did not adversely affect cell viability at concentrations up to 100 muM. This assessment of myristoyl-based transport provides fundamental data needed in understanding the intracellular delivery of myristoylated peptide cargoes for cell-based biochemical studies.},

abstract = {$\delta$-opioid receptors (DORs) form heteromers with $\mu$-opioid receptors (MORs) and negatively regulate MOR-mediated spinal analgesia. However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear. The present study shows that the activity of MORs can be enhanced by preventing MORs from DOR-mediated codegradation. Treatment with DOR-specific agonists led to endocytosis of both DORs and MORs. These receptors were further processed for ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation, resulting in a reduction of surface MORs. Such effects were attenuated by treatment with an interfering peptide containing the first transmembrane domain of MOR (MOR(TM1)), which interacted with DORs and disrupted the MOR/DOR interaction. Furthermore, the systemically applied fusion protein consisting of MOR(TM1) and TAT at the C terminus could disrupt the MOR/DOR interaction in the mouse spinal cord, enhance the morphine analgesia, and reduce the antinociceptive tolerance to morphine. Thus, dissociation of MORs from DORs in the cell membrane is a potential strategy to improve opioid analgesic therapies.},

abstract = {Heptahelical receptors that interact with heterotrimeric G proteins represent the largest family of proteins involved in signal transduction across biological membranes. Although these receptors generally were believed to be monomeric entities, a growing body of evidence suggests that they may form functionally relevant dimers. However, a definitive demonstration of the existence of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) dimers at the surface of living cells is still lacking. Here, using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), as a protein-protein interaction assay in whole cells, we unambiguously demonstrate that the human beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR) forms constitutive homodimers when expressed in HEK-293 cells. Receptor stimulation with the hydrophilic agonist isoproterenol led to an increase in the transfer of energy between beta(2)AR molecules genetically fused to the BRET donor (Renilla luciferase) and acceptor (green fluorescent protein), respectively, indicating that the agonist interacts with receptor dimers at the cell surface. Inhibition of receptor internalization did not prevent agonist-promoted BRET, demonstrating that it did not result from clustering of receptors within endosomes. The notion that receptor dimers exist at the cell surface was confirmed further by the observation that BS3, a cell-impermeable cross-linking agent, increased BRET between beta(2)AR molecules. The selectivity of the constitutive interaction was documented by demonstrating that no BRET occurred between the beta(2)AR and two other unrelated GPCR. In contrast, the well characterized agonist-dependent interaction between the beta(2)AR and the regulatory protein beta-arrestin could be monitored by BRET. Taken together, the data demonstrate that GPCR exist as functional dimers in vivo and that BRET-based assays can be used to study both constitutive and hormone-promoted selective protein-protein interactions.},

abstract = {Opiates such as morphine are the choice analgesic in the treatment of chronic pain. However their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence. Due to its importance in therapy, different strategies have been considered for making opiates such as morphine more effective, while curbing its liability to be abused. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. In particular, delta opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency. The underlying molecular basis for these observations is not understood. We propose the modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors as a potential mechanism. In support of this hypothesis, we show that mu-delta interacting complexes exist in live cells and native membranes and that the occupancy of delta receptors (by antagonists) is sufficient to enhance mu opioid receptor binding and signaling activity. Furthermore, delta receptor antagonists enhance morphine-mediated intrathecal analgesia. Thus, heterodimeric associations between mu-delta opioid receptors can be used as a model for the development of novel combination therapies for the treatment of chronic pain and other pathologies.},

abstract = {One of the assumptions of the mobile receptor hypothesis as it relates to G protein-coupled receptors is that the stoichiometry of receptor, G protein, and effector is 1:1:1 (Bourne, H. R., Sanders, D. A., and McCormick, F.(1990) Nature 348, 125-132). Many studies on the cooperativity of agonist binding are incompatible with this notion and have suggested that both G proteins and their associated receptors can be oligomeric. However, a clear physical demonstration that G protein-coupled receptors can indeed interact as dimers and that such interactions may have functional consequences was lacking. Here, using differential epitope tagging we demonstrate that beta2-adrenergic receptors do form SDS-resistant homodimers and that transmembrane domain VI of the receptor may represent part of an interface for receptor dimerization. The functional importance of dimerization is supported by the observation that a peptide derived from this domain that inhibits dimerization also inhibits beta-adrenergic agonist-promoted stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity. Moreover, agonist stimulation was found to stabilize the dimeric state of the receptor, while inverse agonists favored the monomeric species, which suggests that interconversion between monomeric and dimeric forms may be important for biological activity.},

abstract = {Beta-adrenergic receptors were characterized in human fat cell membranes using 125I-labeled cyanopindolol (125I-labeled CYP) and highly selective beta 1-antagonists. The iodinated radioligand bound saturably and specifically to a single class of high affinity binding sites. The number of binding sites determined with 125I-labeled CYP closely agreed with that determined with two other tritiated radioligands: [3H]dihydroalprenolol and [3H]CGP-12,177. Since 125I-labeled CYP does not discriminate between beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors, the densities of the two receptor subtypes were determined from the competition curves of 125I-labeled CYP by highly selective beta 1-antagonists (bisoprolol, ICI-89,406, CGP-20,712A, and LK-204,545). Moreover, in order to enable correlation with binding data, the regulation of adenylate cyclase activity and of lipolysis was tested with various beta-agonist and antagonist compounds. The results obtained on fat cell membranes from abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue demonstrated the following. 1) 125I-labeled CYP represents a valuable tool for the quantification and the delineation of beta-receptor subtypes. 2) The presence of sodium ions in binding buffers causes a modification of the affinity of beta-sites for some beta-antagonists. 3) The human fat cell beta adrenergic receptor population defined by nonselective radioligands is composed of two subtypes that can be interpreted in terms of classic beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor subtypes as assessed by competition studies with highly selective antagonists; beta 2-sites are predominant (60-70{\%} of 125I-labeled CYP sites) in the adipocytes of slightly overweight women. 4) Results support the idea that beta 1- as well as beta 2-adrenergic receptors are coupled with adenylate cyclase and involved in the induction of lipolysis. 5) The results focus on the interest in some beta 2-agonist drugs (zinterol, clenbuterol) as partial inductors of lipolysis, with the lipolytic efficacies of these compounds being well correlated with their efficacies at 125I-labeled CYP sites.},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors are known to exist as oligomers. Although such aggregates often are referred to as dimers, there is little direct evidence regarding their oligomeric size. In the present investigation, c-Myc-, FLAG-, and influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged forms of the M2 muscarinic receptor have been coexpressed in Sf9 cells to probe for aggregates larger than a dimer. Immunochromatography, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting were carried out with various combinations of antibodies directed against the different epitopes to demonstrate that all three tagged forms of the receptor can be immunopurified within a single complex. Extracts of the M2 muscarinic receptor from Sf9 cells therefore contain aggregates that are at least trimeric, and the levels detected point to the existence of larger complexes. The data also suggest that the oligomers coexist with a sizeable population of monomers.},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent the single largest molecular target of therapeutic drugs currently on the market, and are also the most common target in high throughput screening assays designed to identify potential new drug candidates. A large percentage of these assays are now formatted as radioligand binding assays. Fluorescence polarization ligand binding assays can offer a non-rad alternative to radioligand binding assays. In addition, fluorescence polarization assays are a homogenous format that is easy to automate for high throughput screening. We have developed a series of peptide ligands labeled with the fluorescent dye BODIPY TMR whose binding to GPCRs can be detected using fluorescence polarization methodology. BODIPY TMR has advantages over the more commonly used fluorescein dye in high throughput screening (HTS) assays due to the fact that its excitation and emission spectra are red-shifted approximately 50 nm relative to fluorescein. Assays based on BODIPY TMR ligands are therefore less susceptible to interference from tissue auto-fluorescence in the assay matrix, or the effects of colored or fluorescent compounds in the screening libraries. A series of BODIPY TMR labeled peptides have been prepared that bind to a range of GPCRs including melanin concentrating hormone, bradykinin, and melanocortin receptors. Conditions have been optimized in order to utilize a comparable amount of receptor membrane preparation as is used in a radioligand binding assay. The assays are formatted in 384-well microplates with a standard volume of 40 microL. We have compared the assays across the different fluorescence polarization (FP) readers available to determine the parameters for each instrument necessary to achieve the required precision.},

However, this important aspect of GPCR biology remains largely unincorporated into schemes to search for new therapeutics. This review provides a synopsis of the current thinking surrounding GPCR homo-oligomerization and hetero-oligomerization and shows how new models point towards unexplored avenues in the development of new therapies.},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) self-associate as dimers or higher-order oligomers in living cells. The stability of associated GPCRs has not been extensively studied, but it is generally thought that these receptors move between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments as intact dimers or oligomers. Here we show that $\beta$(2)-adrenergic receptors ($\beta$(2)ARs) that self-associate at the plasma membrane can dissociate during agonist-induced internalization. We use bioluminescence-resonance energy transfer (BRET) to monitor movement of $\beta$(2)ARs between subcellular compartments. BRET between $\beta$(2)ARs and plasma membrane markers decreases in response to agonist activation, while at the same time BRET between $\beta$(2)ARs and endosome markers increases. Energy transfer between $\beta$(2)ARs is decreased in a similar manner if either the donor- or acceptor-labeled receptor is mutated to impair agonist binding and internalization. These changes take place over the course of 30 minutes, persist after agonist is removed, and are sensitive to several inhibitors of arrestin- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The magnitude of the decrease in BRET between donor- and acceptor-labeled $\beta$(2)ARs suggests that at least half of the receptors that contribute to the BRET signal are physically segregated by internalization. These results are consistent with the possibility that $\beta$(2)ARs associate transiently with each other in the plasma membrane, or that $\beta$(2)AR dimers or oligomers are actively disrupted during internalization.},

@article{Cottet2012,
abstract = {The concept of oligomerization of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) opens new perspectives regarding physiological function regulation. The capacity of one GPCR to modify its binding and coupling properties by interacting with a second one can be at the origin of regulations unsuspected two decades ago. Although the concept is interesting, its validation at a physiological level is challenging and probably explains why receptor oligomerization is still controversial. Demonstrating direct interactions between two proteins is not trivial since few techniques present a spatial resolution allowing this precision. Resonance energy transfer (RET) strategies are actually the most convenient ones. During the last two decades, bioluminescent resonance energy transfer and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) have been widely used since they exhibit high signal-to-noise ratio. Most of the experiments based on GPCR labeling have been performed in cell lines and it has been shown that all GPCRs have the propensity to form homo- or hetero-oligomers. However, whether these data can be extrapolated to GPCRs expressed in native tissues and explain receptor functioning in real life, remains an open question. Native tissues impose different constraints since GPCR sequences cannot be modified. Recently, a fluorescent ligand-based GPCR labeling strategy combined to a TR-FRET approach has been successfully used to prove the existence of GPCR oligomerization in native tissues. Although the RET-based strategies are generally quite simple to implement, precautions have to be taken before concluding to the absence or the existence of specific interactions between receptors. For example, one should exclude the possibility of collision of receptors diffusing throughout the membrane leading to a specific FRET signal. The advantages and the limits of different approaches will be reviewed and the consequent perspectives discussed.},

abstract = {Treatment of pain with opioids is limited by their potential abuse liability. In an effort to develop analgesics without this side effect, a series of bivalent ligands containing a mu-opioid receptor agonist pharmacophore connected to a delta-opioid receptor antagonist pharmacophore through variable-length spacers (16-21 atoms) was synthesized. Members of this series [mu-opioid receptor (M)-delta-opioid receptor (D)-agonist (A)-antagonists (N): MDANs] are antinociceptive in the tail flick assay, but antinociceptive tolerance and physical dependence do not develop to ligands having spacers with 19-21 atoms. The current studies compared the rewarding properties of three bivalent ligands (MDAN-16, -19 and -21) and a mu-opioid receptor agonist (MA-19) to those of morphine in the conditioned place preference assay in mice after i.v. administration. Place preference developed to morphine and to MA-19, but not to the MDANs. The responses to MDAN-16 were highly variable, although place preference of borderline significance appeared to develop. Reinstatement was also evaluated after extinguishing morphine conditioned place preference; morphine and MA-19, but not the MDANs, reinstated morphine conditioned place preference. Taken together, these results suggest that the bivalents are less rewarding compared to morphine in opioid-na{\"{\i}}ve mice and do not induce reinstatement in previously morphine-preferring mice. The lack of a conditioned place preference response for MDAN-19 and -21, compared to the equivocal results with MDAN-16, suggests a minimum distance requirement between mu-opioid receptor and delta-opioid receptor recognition sites. This requirement may reflect the binding of MDAN-19 and -21 to mu-opioid receptor-delta-opioid receptor heterodimeric receptors that block reward but not antinociception.},

Here we report the generation of an AGT-based tag, named CLIP-tag, which reacts specifically with O2-benzylcytosine derivatives.

abstract = {The existence of A2A-D2 heteromeric complexes is based on coimmunoprecipitation studies and on fluorescence resonance energy transfer and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer analyses. It has now become possible to show that A2A and D2 receptors also coimmunoprecipitate in striatal tissue, giving evidence for the existence of A2A-D2 heteromeric receptor complexes also in rat striatal tissue. The analysis gives evidence that these heteromers are constitutive, as they are observed in the absence of A2A and D2 agonists. The A2A-D2 heteromers could either be A2A-D2 heterodimers and/or higher-order A2A -D2 hetero-oligomers. In striatal neurons there are probably A2A-D2 heteromeric complexes, together with A2A-D2 homomeric complexes in the neuronal surface membrane. Their stoichiometry in various microdomains will have a major role in determining A2A and D2 signaling in the striatopallidal GABA neurons. Through the use of D2/D1 chimeras, evidence has been obtained that the fifth transmembrane (TM) domain and/or the I3 of the D2 receptor are part of the A2A-D2 receptor interface, where electrostatic epitope-epitope interactions involving the N-terminal part of I3 of the D2 receptor (arginine-rich epitope) play a major role, interacting with the carboxyl terminus of the A2A receptor. Computerized modeling of A2A-D2 heteromers are in line with these findings. It seems likely that A2A receptor-induced reduction of D2 receptor recognition, G protein coupling, and signaling, as well as the existence of A2A-D2 co-trafficking, are the consequence of the existence of an A2A-D2 receptor heteromer. The relevance of A2A-D2 heteromeric receptor complexes for Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia is emphasized as well as for the treatment of these diseases. Finally, recent evidence for the existence of antagonistic A2A-D3 heteromeric receptor complexes in cotransfected cell lines has been summarized.},

abstract = {LGR5+ stem cells reside at crypt bottoms, intermingled with Paneth cells that provide Wnt, Notch and epidermal growth factor signals. Here we find that the related RNF43 and ZNRF3 transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligases are uniquely expressed in LGR5+ stem cells. Simultaneous deletion of the two genes encoding these proteins in the intestinal epithelium of mice induces rapidly growing adenomas containing high numbers of Paneth and LGR5+ stem cells. In vitro, growth of organoids derived from these adenomas is arrested when Wnt secretion is inhibited, indicating a dependence of the adenoma stem cells on Wnt produced by adenoma Paneth cells. In the HEK293T human cancer cell line, expression of RNF43 blocks Wnt responses and targets surface-expressed frizzled receptors to lysosomes. In the RNF43-mutant colorectal cancer cell line HCT116, reconstitution of RNF43 expression removes its response to exogenous Wnt. We conclude that RNF43 and ZNRF3 reduce Wnt signals by selectively ubiquitinating frizzled receptors, thereby targeting these Wnt receptors for degradation.},
